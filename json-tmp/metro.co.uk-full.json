He entered Cator Park shortly after 8pm and lay in wait for half-an-hour before Sabina arrived en route to The Depot bar where she was due to meet a friend.\nMs Morgan said it was \u2018out of character\u2019 for the year one Rushey Green Primary School teacher to be walking through the park after dark, but \u2018she was running late and this was the quickest route to get to the bar\u2019. \nShe was \u2018oblivious\u2019 to her killer as he ran up behind her and attacked her on the path near a park bench.\nThe Old Bailey was told Sabina suffered approximately 34 bows to the head, inflicted with such force that pieces of the sign broke off.\u00a0\nSelamaj\u2019s actions afterwards were out of camera shot, but Sabina was not seen alive again.\nMs Morgan said the defendant asphyxiated her and removed her tights and underwear before trying to cover her body in grass. \nThe prosecution allege there was a sexual motive for killing Sabina, even though there was no \u2018positive\u2019 evidence of a sexual assault.\nSabina\u2019s body was discovered by a dog walker the next day who  at first thought he was seeing a \u2018potato sack\u2019.\nSupporters from the Sabina Project outside the Old Bailey, central London (Picture: PA)Her death led to an outpouring of grief across the nation and led to renewed fury over violence against women in the UK.\nSabina\u2019s family said their world had been \u2018shattered into tiny pieces\u2019 following her murder. \nSister Jebina Yasmin Islam said in an impact statement read out in court: \u2018Our sister\u00a0Sabina\u00a0was way more than just a sister, a daughter, a teacher, she was a life.\n\u2018A life that didn\u2019t deserve to be taken.\n\u2018You snatched her without a second thought.\n\u2018You are not a human, you are a disgusting animal.\n\u2018Our parents are petrified any time one of their girls steps out the house now.\nMore: Crime newsTruly horrifying image shows swastika scratched on corpse of Ukraine rape victim\nWoman who felt threatened on bus got help by dialling 999 and asking for pizza\nTeacher who bombarded schoolboy with sexual WhatsApp messages is spared jail\u2018In our heads we have these images of what happened and what our sister must have felt when you decided to run after her and attack her when clearly she could not defend herself.\n\u2018You planned this and made sure she was alone.\n\u2018What makes us angry is that you left our sister\u2019s body in an unrespectable manner to fulfil your filthy desires.\n\u2018We just want answers as to why you killed her.\nKoci Selamaj has been handed a life sentence  (Picture: PA)\u2018Why?\n\u2018Our family will never forget what you did bit we will not let you take anymore from us.\u2019\nSelamaj had no previous convictions and no Interpol notices before he murdered Sabina.  But the sentencing hearing heard that the killer had a \u2018recent history of violent behaviour towards his ex-wife\u2019 Ionela Ghergishan, including putting his hands around her neck.\nMs Ghergishan said his behaviour towards her changed from May 2021 onwards, when he became \u2018controlling, coercive and physically aggressive\u2019.\nShe said she left him because she started to \u2018fear for her life\u2019, but on the day he killed Sabina, he had got in touch with her to pressure her for sex. \nThe prosecution say Selamaj\u2019s previous violent behaviour should be considered as an \u2018aggravated factor\u2019 in deciding his prison term, as well as his attempt to conceal the body. \nMs Morgan also alleges the attack \u2018did not come about on the spur of the moment\u2019 and there was \u2018significant planning\u2019. \nThree days before the killing, Selamaj booked a room at the five-star Grand Hotel in Eastbourne, the town where he already had accommodation.\nHis reservation was for the night of September 17 and he arrived earlier in the day to check in. \nMembers of the public attend a vigil in memory of Sabina Nessa and in solidarity against violence against women (Picture: PA)Sabina\u2019 death sparked calls for more to be done to keep women safe (Picture: PA)Before leaving the park, he picked up pieces of the warning triangle and used wet wipes to clean a  bench near to where he launched his initial attack.\nEn route back to the south coast, Selamaj stopped in Tunbridge Wells in Kent and dumped the warning triangle in the River Teise.\nSelamaj arrived back at The Grand Hotel at midnight and checked out in the morning before going to work at an Esso garage in Lewes.\nHe was arrested in the seaside town and charged days later.\nHe refused to comment in police interviews but when he was charged, the Albanian national said: \u2018What will happen if I open up now and say everything.\u2019\nMr Justice Sweeney said the \u2018inevitable\u2019 sentence would be life in prison, with a starting point of 30 years.\nHe adjourned the sentencing until 10am on Friday.\nMore: Crime newsTruly horrifying image shows swastika scratched on corpse of Ukraine rape victim\nWoman who felt threatened on bus got help by dialling 999 and asking for pizza\nTeacher who bombarded schoolboy with sexual WhatsApp messages is spared jailAddressing Selamaj, Sabina\u2019s mother and father said: \u2018As a parent, you would never have thought your child would die before you.

You are not a human being, you are an animal.\u2019\nSabina\u2019s death came months after the murder of Sarah Everard, sparking further calls for more to be done to make communities safer for women. \nLisa Williams, head teacher of the school she worked at, described the \u2018devastating\u2019 impact of her murder on staff and pupils. \nShe said Sabina was \u2018a happy, hard-working\u2019  teacher who had a \u2018fulfilling career ahead of her\u2019.\nOn Ms Nessa\u2019s class of 30 students, she said: \u2018For the rest of their lives, these young children will never be able to comprehend why someone murdered their teacher and the world in which they live is not safe for them to play in a\u00a0park.\u2019\nGot a story?

On the first day there were victims \u2013 innocent people.\n\u2018There were constant explosions under which they woke up and fell asleep. The light was gone and it was scary to go outside during the day. \n\u2018Gunshots were heard everywhere.

new edit button"}, {"author_container": "Ryan Coogan"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 15:27:00"}, {"article_body": "\nTwitter is a platform designed to deliver a constant flow of lightning-fast takes and talking points (Picture: Getty)It\u2019s one of the most viscerally upsetting things that can happen to you on Twitter \u2013 apart from maybe crypto bros and neo-Nazis \u2013 realising the viral tweet you sent out earlier had a typo in it.\u00a0\nYou rush to delete it before seeing that it\u2019s already amassed a few hundred likes and retweets, and you\u2019re left to make an impossible choice: do I delete it now and deny myself all that sweet, sweet internet approval?\u00a0\nOr do I let it stand and expose myself to the world as an idiot who doesn\u2019t know the difference between \u2018there\u2019 and \u2018they\u2019re\u2019?\u00a0\nIt\u2019s little surprise then that Twitter users have been asking for an edit button for quite some time, to ensure that they\u2019ll never again have to repost a tweet because they accidentally called Kanye West a \u2018ducking idiot\u2019.\u00a0\nTheir prayers were finally answered last week, when the platform announced that it has been working on an edit function for the past year, after newly minted largest shareholder Elon Musk ran a poll on his account asking his followers if that was something they\u2019d be interested in.\u00a0\u00a0\nMany, myself included, have questioned the wisdom of implementing a function that would allow users to alter past tweets on a platform already rife with misinformation.\u00a0\nThe new feature\u2019s reveal was tinged with ambiguity: users were sceptical of Twitter\u2019s claim that the change hadn\u2019t been prompted by Musk\u2019s poll, further complicated by the fact the announcement came on April Fool\u2019s Day, leading many to wonder whether the edit button was in fact just a massive joke.\nFor a change that has prompted concerns about increasing the ability to lie on the internet, it wasn\u2019t a particularly auspicious start.\nIf the past few tumultuous years have taught us anything, it\u2019s that social media is plagued by bad-faith actors and propaganda.\u00a0\nTwitter, as a platform designed to deliver a constant flow of lightning-fast takes and talking points, is no exception to this.\nIt only takes minutes for somebody with an agenda to create an anonymous account, comment \u2018actually I heard the opposite of this is true\u2019 under whatever information doesn\u2019t line up with their prejudices, and wait for some poor trusting soul to take their hastily-tweeted conspiracy as gospel.\nFor me, the main danger of an edit function is that somebody could tweet out something innocuous, have it go viral, and then change it to some form of misinformation or hate speech that can reach an audience far beyond what it normally would.\u00a0\u00a0\nImagine if, at the height of the pandemic, people had used this method to push anti-vaccine propaganda \u2013 leading to sensible people inadvertently sharing misinformation.\nSuddenly your less tech-savvy aunt sees that you\u2019ve retweeted the phrase \u2018Dr Fauci invented Pfizer to make you sterile\u2019 \u2013\u00a0at best she thinks her nephew has gone off the deep end, and at worst she\u2019s rethinking her attitude towards conventional medicine at the worst possible time.\u00a0\nAs a former teacher, I\u2019m well aware of how careful some people need to be about their social media use, and how misunderstandings can snowball into a sackable offence.\nI don\u2019t want to find myself commenting \u2018hard agree\u2019 under a tweet that once said \u2018doughnuts are better than bagels\u2019 but now reads \u2018I think 10-year-olds should be forcibly conscripted into military service.\u2019\nIf the past few tumultuous years have taught us anything, it\u2019s that social media is plagued by bad-faith actors and propaganda\u00a0\nJay Sullivan, Twitter\u2019s vice president of consumer product, acknowledged that without \u2018time limits, controls, and transparency about what has been edited, Edit could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation,\u2019 and while that\u2019s certainly encouraging, I think it ignores the core nature of Twitter as a platform.\u00a0\nMaybe they\u2019ll implement an \u2018edit history\u2019 function similar to Facebook, which allows users to track any changes made to posts after the fact, but Twitter is a different platform, with a far different approach to consumption of information.\u00a0\nIn my experience, people aren\u2019t there to do their due diligence; they\u2019re there to scroll through 50 variations of the same joke and then contribute their own, even worse version.\u00a0\nAs sceptical as I am about the edit button, there are still things Twitter could do to lessen the impact of it being abused.\u00a0\nThey could ensure that a tweet can\u2019t be edited after it receives a certain number of likes or impressions, to prevent people from capitalising on a tweet\u2019s popularity.\u00a0\nThey could make it impossible to edit a tweet after more than a few minutes, hours or days. They could restrict edits to people with verified accounts to try and increase accountability (I\u2019m sure that would go down well among those of us not lucky enough to be blessed with the blue tick).\u00a0\u00a0\nBut with trolls and propagandists already managing to cause enough havoc under the current system, is it crazy to suggest that they might do even more damage with that extra bit of leeway, no matter how many safeguards are in place?\u00a0\nToxicity is endemic to social media, and without strict reforms that seems unlikely to change.\nMore: TechThe 5 best WhatsApp privacy tips you need to know about\nElon Musk is the richest person in the world.

It might be time for a frank conversation. \nThe problem:\nMy girlfriend has made it clear from the start that, due to a religious conversion, she will abstain from sex until marriage. \nI\u2019ve wondered if this is an excuse and a means of control. I also wonder whether we\u2019ve bonded. \nWe met in America but when I was made redundant, I relocated back to the UK. I don\u2019t want her here until I\u2019m settled and she understands this because I have to sponsor her immigration and we both need to be on a secure footing. \nShe\u2019s open to coming over as a tourist for a few months to test the waters but should this \u2018no sex until marriage\u2019 rule be a red flag?\nWhat the experts say: \nSex can be a testing ground for deeper emotional problems, so it does help with bonding, but there are many ways to know someone intimately. More importantly, do you see a life together?\n\u2018At no point do you tell us what it is you love about her or what you enjoy doing together,\u2019 says Dr Angharad Rudkin. \u2018This sex embargo is now the main focus of your thoughts and it is obscuring all other aspects of your relationship.\u2019\nYou fear she is manipulating you on some level and therefore isn\u2019t sincerely committed.\n\u2018Is this a conversation you can have with her?\u2019 says Rupert Smith. \u2018If you have serious doubts about her, I\u2019d say that any thoughts of marriage should be out of the question.\u2019\nBut since she has been clear from the start that she doesn\u2019t believe in sex before marriage \u2013 and that is her prerogative \u2013 you have the choice of being with her on this condition or ending the relationship. Instead of focusing on her, turn your attention towards yourself.\n\u2018Using both your logic and your emotional gut instinct, weigh up what you receive from the relationship versus the constraints,\u2019 says Rudkin. \u2018If you enjoy spending time with her, trust her and feel truly loved by her, then waiting to have sex shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u2019\nMore: SexEV charger hacked with very fruity content on display instead of council website\nMy life as a dominatrix: 'Most of my clients are married - their wives would be horrified'\nCan you have sex during Ramadan?If you decide you still wish to invite her over to test the waters, ensure you\u2019re testing the right waters.\n\u2018Test your relationship, not its sexual expression,\u2019 says James McConnachie. \u2018If your relationship is strong, you can wait. There are other ways to express emotional and sexual feelings \u2013 and many kinds of sex that don\u2019t involve penetration. Have you had this conversation?\u2019\nBut what is clear is that you cannot stay with her in the hope she will change. This will guarantee an unhappy relationship.\n\u2018You must not feel pressured to marry her in order to have sex either,\u2019 says Rudkin.\nIt is a difficult decision you have to make \u2013 one made harder by the sense you feel somewhat forced into making it. But take sex out of the equation, as she has, and be honest about what else you have. You should have your answer then.\u00a0The experts\nRupert Smith is an author and counsellor\nJames McConnachie is the author of Sex (Rough Guides)\nDr Angharad Rudkin is a clinical psychologist\nGot a sex and dating dilemma?\nTo get expert advice, send your problem to lisa.scott@metro.co.uk\n\tMORE : How to stop being so influenced by others when it comes to dating\n\tMORE : Loved-up Kim Kardashian opens up on budding Pete Davidson romance: \u2018I\u2019m very happy and very content\u2019\n\tMORE : Eight expert tips for making an open relationship work\n\t\t\t\tRush Hour Crush - love (well, lust) is all around us\t\t\tVisit Metro's Rush Hour Crush online every weekday at 4:30pm. \nTell us about your Rush Hour Crush by submitting them here,  and you could see your message published on the site.

He\u2019s even had a go with his own cooking show.\nWhat does Brooklyn Beckham actually do for a living?\nAs the eldest son of the former footballer and Spice Girl-turned-fashion-designer, Brooklyn has dipped his toes into various industries, from becoming his dad\u2019s mini-me as a teen footballer, to copying his mum with a modelling career.\nBrooklyn\u2019 is the eldest son of power couple

ambassador for Huawei with their Honor 8 smartphone line, alongside Scarlett Johansson, Karlie Kloss and Henry Cavill.\nIn 2016, aged 16, Brooklyn decided to swap posing in front of the camera to taking control of the lens, and photographed a campaign for Burberry BRIT, which was met with widespread criticism as some people in the industry branded his appointment nepotism.\nBrooklyn collaborated as the photographer and ambassador of Pepe Jeans\u2019 Wiser Future campaign with Nicola (Picture: Pepe Jeans)A year later, he announced he would be attending Parsons School of Design in New York for a photography degree, and published his first book of photography, titled What I See, shortly after.\nFans weren\u2019t too impressed by his photography, and Brooklyn faced a lot of

become a chef.\nHowever, he faced heavy criticism after it was revealed that one episode of the show in which he made a sandwich reportedly cost $100,000 (\u00a374,000) to make.\u00a0\nThe eight-minute show also had a reported crew of 62 people to\u00a0film him making a bagel sandwich\u00a0with coleslaw, a hash brown and fried sea bream.\u00a0\nIn the show\u2019s trailer, Brooklyn says: \u2018My name is Brooklyn Beckham and I just love to cook\u2026 I am not a chef yet, this is the very start of my food journey.\u2019\nHe continues: \u2018I love making food for the people that I love

$10million (\u00a37.6million).\nWho is his fianc\u00e9e Nicola Peltz?\nBrooklyn\u2019s lavish background is minor compared to that of his fianc\u00e9e, the daughter of a billionaire whose net worth is reported to be $1.8billion (\u00a31.4billion), who has donated to Donald Trump\u2019s campaigns in the past, but has since claimed he\u2019s sorry for voting for the former president.\nNicola, who is four years older than Brooklyn, starred in Marvel\u2019s Inhumans and in drama-thriller series Bates Motel.\nShe\u2019s also walked the runway for Alexander Wang at Paris Fashion Week in 2015, and appeared in music videos for Zayn Malik and Miley Cyrus.\nThe couple have been engaged for two years (Picture: @brooklynbeckham)Like Brooklyn, Nicola comes from an all-star family, as the daughter of

Peltz, CEO of social networking company Twenty and one of Forbes\u2019 30 Under 30 list for Consumer Technology in 2020.\nWhen are they getting married?\nAfter their\u00a0whirlwind romance, in July

I asked the nurse on duty \u2018Am I being daft or is there some sort of joke going on?\u2019\nThe nurse said \u2018Steve Arnott \u2013 Line of Duty, DCI Arnott\u2019. \nI just didn\u2019t get it at all and didn\u2019t have the energy to discuss it so I just pressed my morphine button as I thought I was tripping out again!\nAlready struggling to process who the second Steve Arnott was, I was under the influence of some of the hospital\u2019s pharmaceuticals, making it even harder to know what was going on.\nBeing told it was due to a BBC TV show didn\u2019t help matters much as I had featured in my own documentary on BBC2 in November 2018 called A Northern Soul.\nTo confuse things even further, Martin Compston, the actor who plays Steve Arnott, had starred in a Northern Soul themed film in 2010 called SoulBoy.\nI\u2019m actually starting to think that out of the two Steve Arnotts I\u2019d make the best detective (Picture: Sean Mcallister and Jillian Edelstein)Even after having things explained to me, I wasn\u2019t entirely up to speed as I had honestly never heard of my alter ego and hadn\u2019t yet watched Line of Duty, though I now appreciate how popular the show is.\nWhen I got out of hospital I knew I had to watch this show to see if DCI Steve Arnott had any resemblance to me beyond our names being the same.\nSafe to say the answer was a firm no, as Martin Compston is small with dark hair and is Scottish (though he plays an Englishman in the show) while I am basically the opposite \u2013 tall with blonde hair and English.\nHaving now watched the show, I\u2019m actually starting to think that out of the two Steve Arnotts I\u2019d make the best detective \u2013 he seemed to be struggling in every episode, bless him!\nBut there\u2019s no denying that having the same name as a famous character has had an impact on my life \u2013 it\u2019s often the first thing people react to when I introduce myself.\nAmong the common responses are: \u2018What\u2019s H like?\u2019, \u2018Never knew you were a detective\u2019, and most annoyingly: \u2018Steve Arnott, he\u2019s the little one right?\u2019\nOne of my favourite moments was when the League of Gentlemen actor Steve Pemberton, who had watched both my documentary and Line of Duty, tweeted me to say \u2018There\u2019s Only One Steve Arnott\u2019.\nThat made me smile as I\u2019m a huge fan of Steve and Reece Shearsmith\u2019s work.\nThe main benefit of having people speak up when they hear my name is that it gives me the chance to tell them about the real-life Steve Arnott.\nIt\u2019s a great way to be able to speak about Beats Bus Records, the record label and community project I founded, and the important work and campaigns we lead in Yorkshire and the Humber

biphobia from colleagues"}, {"author_container": "Liz Willow"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 12:53:00"}, {"article_body": "\nNow I finally feel at peace with who I am (Picture: Liz Willow)A few years ago, I mentioned to a gay colleague that I was bisexual. \n\u2018But have you ever dated a woman?\u2019 he asked. When I admitted, somewhat shamefaced, that I had not, he shrugged and said \u2018Well, you\u2019re not really bi then, are you?\u2019\nI went silent and my heart dropped \u2013 I wished I had never shared my sexuality at all.\nThose words did so much damage to my confidence that I waited years to explicitly mention my sexuality at work again.\nThankfully, I\u2019m comfortable with my sexuality today and am in a job where I feel safe enough to be myself. But not everyone can say the same.\nA 2020 Stonewall report indicated that two in five bi people hide their sexual orientation at work for fear of discrimination. Until relatively recently, I was part of that statistic.\nI first came out as bisexual to most of my family and friends in my mid to late 20s, but I\u2019ve hid my sexuality for most of my professional life.\nWhen attempting to come out in the past, I\u2019ve been met with flat-out disbelief, \u2018jokes\u2019 about bisexuals being \u2018greedy\u2019 and even that classic line, \u2018it\u2019s just a phase\u2019.\nEven in LGBT+ circles, I would overhear gay and lesbian colleagues talking about relationships and LGBT+ events, and desperately want to join in, but I didn\u2019t know how.\nI still have the vivid memory of an ex senior colleague asking me about threesomes after I mentioned that I was bisexual. Instead of a valid part of my identity in a professional context, my sexuality was suddenly reduced to a way to objectify me.\nThese experiences led to me deciding that being open wasn\u2019t worth it. Not if I wanted to feel safe and accepted at work, at least superficially.\nBut hiding my sexuality felt like a weight in my chest \u2013 heavy and exhausting.\nEach time someone assumed I was straight (and I didn\u2019t correct them) I would feel my sense of self dwindle.\nI\u2019ve experienced anxiety and depression for most of my adult life. Hiding my sexuality at work worsened my feelings of isolation, separating me further from my colleagues and friends. When kind managers or colleagues tried to offer me support, they weren\u2019t able to understand what I was going through, because an important piece of the puzzle was missing.\nMy lack of confidence in expressing my sexuality bled into all areas of my life. I wasn\u2019t able to be myself fully in my relationships, homelife or work. This only worsened my mental health \u2013 increasing my exhaustion and lack of self-belief.\nEverything changed when I started my current job in 2019.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was fully myself at work that I realised the complete effect that hiding my sexuality was having on my mental health\nA few months after starting my new role, I noticed an article profiling an openly bisexual staff on our intranet for international Bi Visibility Day. The staff member talked about their day job, why they chose to come out as bi at work and the barriers that bi people face.\nAs I read it, I thought to myself, \u2018If they can come out as bi at work, so can I.\u2019 I was still apprehensive, but it gave me confidence I hadn\u2019t felt before.\nAfter a year in the role, I finally came out to my line manager. My heart was beating out of my chest when I told him that I was bisexual and that my new partner was a woman during my end of year review. Old fears of not being believed or having my orientation laughed off came rushing back to the surface.\nThankfully, he was incredibly supportive. He listened to me, believed me, and asked how he could support me.\nLater, he even helped me share my orientation with my wider team, casually, via our team group chat. My team were immediately supportive. In catch-ups, they would regularly ask how my partner was, and one of my colleagues ended up knitting her a scarf.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was fully myself at work that I realised the complete effect that hiding my sexuality was having on my mental health. Knowing that my workplace truly embraced my whole self dramatically increased my confidence.\nInstead of an underlying sense of unease \u2013 worrying whether a manager would accept me if they knew the truth \u2013 I felt able to take more initiative at work and take on new projects. I eventually successfully applied for a more challenging role in an internal team, and then a promotion.\nNot everyone feels the need to come out at work, but for me it was an important step towards self-acceptance.\u00a0\nWhile my depression and anxiety are still there, I feel more at peace with who I am, and my ability to manage my symptoms at work has improved.\nSoon I became involved in our LGBT+ Network, first as an Area Representative and then a national Bi Lead. I started to help organise events and re-started our Bi Inclusion Group with the aim of providing a space where staff who are attracted to more than one gender can share our experiences and help make our workplace more inclusive.\nI was lucky enough to receive a Stonewall Changemaker of the Year Award earlier this year.\nWhen I talk with my Bi Inclusion Group, I\u2019m often blown away at how what I thought was a personal experience and individual to me is part of the wider bi experience.\nMany bi people worry that their sexuality is not valid, they don\u2019t always feel welcome at LGBT+ events or feel invisible if they are in a long-term relationship that looks heterosexual from the outside.\nBisexuality is often considered \u2018half-gay\u2019 and people expect us to experience a watered-down version of homophobia. This erasure and the constant need to hide who you are, even within your own community, is exhausting.\nResearch from Stonewall shows that bi staff may be less likely to report discrimination and may not seek out support when they need it. Bi people also self-report worse mental health outcomes than our lesbian or gay counterparts \u2013 with contributing factors being discrimination, harassment, and rejection from family and friends.\u00a0\nJust because a workplace has openly gay and lesbian staff in positions of senior management, it doesn\u2019t automatically mean that bi staff feel any safer to be themselves.\nBeing an LGBT+ inclusive employer is a commitment to uplift every member of our community. With 43% of young people between the ages of 18-24 now identifying somewhere between \u2018totally straight\u2019 and \u2018totally gay\u2019, bi people now make up a large part of the workforce and it\u2019s time for employers to step up.\nMore: Mental healthBrits are 'more exhausted than ever before' - over a third are on the brink of burnout\nWhat to do if you've become 'enmeshed' in a relationship\nI suffered through my pregnancy with vomiting - don't call it 'morning sickness'If you want to make your work more inclusive, some easy first steps are to include bi speakers at LGBT+ events, explicitly mention bi people and biphobia in LGBT+ policies \u2013 or even celebrating Bi Visibility Day on 23 September.\nThe mental health aspect of workplace inclusion is too-often overlooked, but when employers have the courage to truly support all LGBT+ people, it can be life changing.\nIt\u2019s been a huge relief to bring my whole self to work and I know employers can do more to support bi people like me.\nWhen I\u2019m not hiding who I am, I have more energy to complete quality work and support my colleagues.\nDo you have a story you\u2019d like to share?

widespread outrage and travel chaos (Picture: PA)P&O Ferries says it is set to restart sailing this weekend on routes it has been suspended from after sacking nearly 800 seafarers on the spot.\nThe firm, widely slated for its conduct last month, has been prevented from running all but one ship since the redundancy debacle on March 17.\nNow it says it will resume operations on four vessels \u2013 but it is unclear if the authorities will allow it.\nThe company sparked outrage by replacing its crews with cheaper agency workers, without any notice, on March 17, sparking a major backlash from politicians, unions and the public.\nThere were safety concerns about continuing to allow the vessels to sail.\nThe resulting suspension has contributed to further chaos and queues at ports in recent weeks. \nA spokesman for the firm now says: \u2018From this weekend, P&O Ferries are getting ready to resume services across a number of vital routes.\nP&O Ferries replaced its sacked staff with agency workers on cheaper contracts (Picture: PA)\u2018P&O has been working closely with regulators to ensure our ships are safe to sail.\n\u2018P&O is looking forward to welcoming back vital services and we expect to have two of our vessels ready to sail on the Dover/Calais route by next week, subject to regulatory sign-off, namely both the Pride of Kent and Spirit of Britain between Dover/Calais.\n\u2018P&O are also expecting to be able to sail both the European Causeway, which runs between Larne and Cairnryan, and the Pride of Hull, which runs services between Hull and Rotterdam.\u2019\nHe continued: \u2018We thank our customers for their patience during this time and we apologise to those customers whose journeys have been cancelled and disrupted.\u2019\nThe

the appropriate time\u2019.\nThe announcement comes as a former P&O Ferries chef is suing the company for unfair dismissal, racial discrimination and harassment.\nThe BBC reported that John Lansdown has filed a tribunal claim against the firm and its chief executive, and is seeking financial compensation and exemplary damages of up to \u00a376 million.\nP&O Ferries denies wrongdoing over the incident.\nMeanwhile, criminal and civil investigations have also been launched into the sackings last month.\nBrit security guard accused of spying for Russia extradited from GermanyBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed on April 1 that the Insolvency Service had started \u2018formal criminal and civil investigations\u2019.\nThe Insolvency Service added: \u2018Following its inquiries, the Insolvency Service has commenced formal criminal and civil investigations into the circumstances surrounding the recent redundancies made by P&O Ferries.\n\u2018As these are ongoing investigations, no further comment or information can be provided at this time.\u2019\nP&O Ferries chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, has already told a joint hearing of the Commons\u2019 business

presenter, 61 \u2013 who was seen sitting in his Diddly Squat Farm office \u2013 apologised for \u2018barging\u2019 in but asked fans to help beekeeper Viktor, who is of Ukrainian descent.\n\u2018He\u2019s got a lot of family and friends who are stuck there and they need our help,\u2019 Jeremy said.\nAddressing the link attached to the post, the journalist said that fans can donate money to help Viktor\u2019s family \u2018buy vehicles that they need to evacuate people that are stuck behind the Russian lines.\u2019\nHe continued: \u2018I can hardly believe I\u2019m saying this in Europe today, but anyway.\u2019\n\u2018I can hardly believe I\u2019m saying this in Europe today,\u2019 said Jeremy (Picture: jeremyclarkson1/Instagram)Viktor Zaichenko is the beekeeper on Jeremy\u2019s beloved Diddly Squat Farm (Picture: Viktor Zaichenko)\u2018They are stuck and we need to get them out, so pickup trucks, anything they can get their hands on, that\u2019s what they need the money for,\u2019 he added.\nViktor\u2019s crowdfunding page has raised over \u00a326,000 at the time of writing, and his personal message explains that \u2018the destruction of Ukraine is on a scale none of us ever imagined could happen, and the speed at which it has happened is still difficult to fathom.\u2019\n\u2018We are immensely grateful to have the support of our friends here in the UK: Jeremy, Lisa and the wonderful team at Diddly Squat who have promised to help us with sourcing the vehicles that we need, and maybe find us some brave drivers who will deliver them over the Ukranian border too.\u2019\nAfter Jeremy posted his plea online, the star shared a video of him reuniting with his farming sidekick Kaleb Cooper at the local pub. \nFilming for Clarkson\u2019s Farm began last year and reunites the whole Diddly Squat crew.\nMore: Russia-Ukraine warPutin 'facing mutiny after 60 elite paratroopers refuse to fight in Ukraine'\nRussia suspended from UN Human Rights

(pic: Twitter)A mysterious new photo has been added to the remaster of GTA: Sand Andreas and it may be intended as a hint about GTA 6.\nWith so little official information to go on, Grand Theft Auto fans have grasped onto almost anything over the past few years, in the hope that it\u2019s a clue or hint about GTA 6.\nThe worst thing is that, until the game comes out, there\u2019s no way of knowing whether they were hints or just people getting excited over nothing, but there is definitely a strange new addition to the Definitive Edition of San Andreas.\nThe framed photo above has mysteriously appeared in the recent remaster and no one is sure why or what it\u2019s supposed to represent, although GTA insider Matheusvictorbr- claims that they have had it confirmed that the image is from \u2018the next title of the Grand Theft Auto series\u2019.\nSome fans have suggested it\u2019s actually a reference to 2011 Rockstar game L.A. Noire, but the house isn\u2019t identical to any from the game and that doesn\u2019t answer why anyone would go to the effort of adding such a thing.\nConsidering how rushed and buggy the Definitive Editions were you wouldn\u2019t have thought anyone would have time for anything but essential work.\nAccording to Matheusvictorbr-, via Google Translate, the in-game location is inspired by the suburbs near Hollywood, Florida.\nMore: Games newsThe House Of The Dead: Remake review - the original zombie shooter\n\u2018Will Smith\u2019 is invading Elden Ring games to slap people and then leave\nChrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition review \u2013 the future agreed to changeAlthough that\u2019s never featured in the games before, Vice City is supposed to be in Florida, as an analogue of Miami, and many previous rumours have suggested that the setting of GTA 6 will return there.\nExcept the new photo is in the remaster of San Andreas, so does that mean that both cities will be in the new game? And maybe Liberty City as well?\nOnly Rockstar can answer that and while they\u2019ve said that the game is \u2018well underway\u2019, even the most optimistic estimate of its release date doesn\u2019t put it any earlier than 2024.It is a very low resolution picture from GTA SA Definitive Edition.

But which appliances are the worst culprits?\nAs the energy price cap has risen by 54% since the start of the month, Kesseler\u2018s energy saving expert, Claire Horne, has revealed the five often overlooked appliances that are increasing your energy bills. \nThankfully, she also offers tips on how best to reduce your energy consumption, resulting in cheaper energy bills.\nFridge and freezer\nIs your fridge working too hard? (Picture: Getty)\u2018A fridge/freezer is one of the biggest culprits for consuming lots of energy, with 12% of the average household\u2019s energy bill caused by its fridge/freezer,\u2019 says Claire.\nObviously you can\u2019t just switch your fridge off to save money, but Claire says the way you use the appliance can help reduce the amount of power it uses. \n\u2018Firstly, the more products it contains, the harder it needs to work in order to stay cool and work properly, so begin by making sure you do not overload the fridge,\u2019 she says. \n\u2018Being mindful on what food you really need to buy not only helps you save money on your energy bill, but can also help save you money on your food shop.\n\u2018Another way to help keep your fridge running efficiently is to make sure you defrost it regularly. Even just one quarter of an inch can reduce the efficiency of a freezer by 10%. so make sure all built up ice is removed.\u2019\nExtractor fan\n\u2018Although a necessity for any kitchen, if an extractor fan is not used correctly then it can be costly to your energy bill,\u2019 says Claire.\nTo use your extractor fan properly, Claire says you should turn it on when you start cooking but only keep it running for 5-10 minutes after you finish, which she says should be enough time to remove any smells or fumes from the air. \n\u2018If after doing this you notice your fan isn\u2019t working as efficiently as it should, then the best thing to do is hire an engineer to take a look,\u2019 she adds. \u2018An inefficient extractor fan will encourage users to keep it on for longer, which can potentially add up to \u00a320 per year to your bill.\u2019\nOven\nSad news for anyone who hates cleaning their oven, but a dirty oven uses more energy to cook properly than a clean one, and Claire says this can add up to \u00a330 per year to your energy bill. \n\u2018Although a deep clean of the oven might be the last thing on your mind, it may help keep your oven working efficiently and save you money in the process,\u2019 she says. \n\u2018If your oven is considerably clean yet you notice it isn\u2019t working as efficiently as it should be, then you may need to consider an oven repair or replacement. Buying a new, energy-efficient oven can help reduce future bills by as much as 40%, depending on what type of oven you opt for.\n\u2018A simple tip to take on in the meantime is turn your oven off up to five minutes before you have finished cooking, ensuring you leave the oven door shut for this period. The oven will stay warm enough during this time, so your food will still be cooked to completion.\n\u2018Doing this at every meal time will considerably lower your energy bill.\u2019\nElectric hob\nThey tend to take longer to heat up (Picture: Getty)Claire says electric hobs are one of the biggest energy consumers in your kitchen, with the average household spending \u00a390 a year on using hobs alone, especially as they take longer to heat up than a gas hob, which provides instant heat. \n\u2018The average cost of an electric hob will increase the older the hob gets or if the hob becomes damaged and dirty, so maintenance is crucial to keep it running as efficiently as possible,\u2019 she says. \n\u2018The electric hob\u2019s energy use can also be impacted by the size of the pans used. It\u2019s a myth that using a smaller pan on a bigger hob will make the pan heat up quicker, instead it will simply waste more energy. Instead, make sure you use the correct sized pan for each ring.\n\u2018Be mindful when using the hob. If you simply need to heat up leftovers then try to avoid using the hob for this task and instead opt for the microwave. \n\u2018The microwave is the most energy-efficient way to cook, as using a microwave for 10 minutes per day will only cost \u00a33 a year.\u2019\nKettle\nWe\u2019re a nation of tea-lovers, but filling up your kettle to the maximum amount is a costly habit. \n\u2018In fact,\u2019 Claire says, \u2018research shows that boiling your full kettle just four times a day can add \u00a360 to your energy bill. Being mindful with how much water you really need means less electricity waste and can help save water too.\n\u2018It is unsurprising that using the kettle will add to energy bills, however even just leaving the kettle plugged in and switched on can add an unnecessary amount to your energy bill. \n\u2018By not switching your kettle off at the mains, electricity will continue to run through, adding \u00a310 to your annual bill. Avoid this unnecessary expense by simply switching off the kettle at the plug whenever you aren\u2019t using it.\u2019\nMore: MoneyLife-changing \u00a34,000,000 up for grabs after no one scoops Lotto jackpot\nHow much does it cost to run an electric blanket?\nHow much does it cost to leave your TV on standby all the time?How else can I save money in the kitchen?\nClaire has some more money-savvy tips that you can use in the kitchen: \n\u2018If you are buying new appliances then make sure you buy the correct sizes for your home,\u2019 she says. \u2018Buying a fridge which is big enough to keep food for a family of six when you live on your own will cost much more than necessary. \n\u2018On the other hand, buying smaller appliances, in an attempt to save money, when actually you require a much bigger fridge space, will cause your fridge to work harder to keep food cooler, resulting in more money spent on your bill.\u2019\nClaire adds that it\u2019s also wise to check the energy ratings on any new appliances you are investing in. \n\u2018All appliances are given an A-Grating, with many on the higher end of the scale being a similar price to those on the lower end,\u2019 she explains. \u2018It is advisable to opt for an appliance with a better energy rating, as having a more energy efficient appliance will save money in the long run, as well as reduce your household\u2019s carbon footprint.\u2019\nDo you have a story to share?\nGet in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.\n\tMORE : Nutritionist reveals what to eat for breakfast to boost your energy levels\n\tMORE : What to do if your energy bill is wrong\n\tMORE : Woman who thought she was just bloated stunned after giving birth to her sixth baby on the toilet "}, {"images": [{"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-188012621.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C509", "alt": "Stylish kitchen counter with appliances"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1345111398.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=540%2C362", "alt": "Kitchen interior with food on counter"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1318880219.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=540%2C360", "alt": "Woman preparing food on modern cooktop"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SEC_97592797.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=480&h=360&crop=1&zoom=1", "alt": "zone post image for post 16424799"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SEC_97534833.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=480&h=360&crop=1&zoom=1", "alt": "zone post image for post 16421259"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1168921070-8a30.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=480&h=360&crop=1&zoom=1", "alt": "zone post image for post 16387670"}]}]}, {"url": "https://metro.co.uk/2022/04/07/sam-star-jude-riordans-brother-was-in-coronation-street-last-night-16421359/", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Sam star Jude Riordan\u2019s brother was in Coronation Street last night \u2013 did you spot him?"}, {"author_container": "Calli Kitson"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 09:23:00"}, {"article_body": "\nSam recently told Nick he had been playing chess with Roy behind his back (Picture: ITV)Sam Blakeman (Jude Riordan) faced an intense afternoon in last night\u2019s episode of Coronation Street as he attended a chess tournament.\nAfter spending time playing chess with Roy (David Neilson), Sam put his skills to the test and made it to the semi-final of the game.\nHis opponent was a teenager who didn\u2019t talk and got \u2018in the zone\u2019 by listening to a mindfulness app through his headphones.\nSam successfully beat Oscar and, just as Roy taught him, he offered a friendly handshake as the game ended.\nOscar was annoyed he had lost and stormed out of the restaurant.\nAfter the scenes aired, actor Jude revealed his brother actually played the role of Oscar!\n\u2018When it was bring your brother to work day.

that Boris Johnson cannot be trusted"}, {"author_container": "Caroline Lucas"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 10:24:00"}, {"article_body": "\nHow can we believe a word that comes out of our Prime Minister\u2019s mouth?\u00a0(Picture: EPA)Partygate has made it crystal clear: the Government says one thing and does another.\u00a0\nAnd the implications are considerably more far reaching and grave than the mere issuing of fines for wrongdoing suggests.\nThere\u2019s not only a disconnect between this Government\u2019s words and its actions, but between its words from one minute to the next.\u00a0\nThis is about trust.\nAnd with the catalogue of U-turns expanding on a seemingly weekly basis, things couldn\u2019t be any more contradictory and conflicting, inconsistent and incoherent.\u00a0\nSo how can we believe a word that comes out of our Prime Minister\u2019s mouth?\u00a0\u00a0\nThere are at least three different categories of U-turn from our flip-flopping Government.\u00a0\nAnd none of these are the kind that arise from listening, learning and being willing to admit when you\u2019ve got it wrong.\u00a0\u00a0\nFirstly, there\u2019s the reverse ferret \u2013 being utterly shamed into a change of policy after a devastating backlash \u2013 as we saw recently on the Ukraine visa process.\u00a0\nPriti Patel appeared to offer a heartfelt welcome to refugees fleeing a brutal war, while simultaneously throwing every possible bureaucratic blockade in their path.\nThis is a Home Office omnishambles \u2013 from being unable to respond to basic Parliamentary requests for answers on EU settlement scheme applications, to a frail grandmother of my constituent having her visa stamp denied because a different visa scheme was allegedly taking priority.\u00a0\nIt was only after MPs berated the Home Secretary that she did a screeching U-turn to allow applications online and biometrics to be processed here in the UK.\u00a0\nGlad as I am that the policy was eventually improved, reverse ferrets such as these can only undo so much damage.\nWith chaos and callousness still the order of the day at the Home Office \u2013 and only 500 applicants under the scheme yet to reach the UK \u2013 I\u2019m ashamed and furious at the Government\u2019s empty promises to desperate Ukrainians in peril.\u00a0To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrowser that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupports HTML5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvideo\nSecondly, there\u2019s the convenient back-pedal \u2013 take fracking as an example.\u00a0\nIn 2019, in one of his earliest acts as Prime Minister, Johnson adopted an immediate ban on shale gas drilling.\u00a0\nThe Conservatives have spent years exploring, probing, inquiring, digging \u2013 thousands of warm words, millions in taxpayers\u2019 money, and yet barely any gas has actually ended up contributing to our energy supply.\nThankfully, Johnson and the Tories appeared to wake up to its follies: a plethora of economic and local environmental problems and, most critically, more carbon emissions gushing into our already overheating atmosphere.\u00a0\nAnd yet with timing that would be impeccable if it wasn\u2019t so scandalous, hours after a major new IPCC report stated it\u2019s \u2018now or never\u2019 to avert climate catastrophe, fracking is now back under Government review.\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t need another review to tell us what the UN Secretary-General stated loud and clear earlier this week \u2013 that investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is \u2018moral and economic madness\u2019.\u00a0\nThis may be a convenient U-turn for the Prime Minister, just when he wants to appease Tory backbenchers, but it\u2019s an unmitigated disaster for the rest of us.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd finally, there\u2019s farce, as demonstrated by the supposed LGBT+ conversion therapy ban last week \u2013 resulting in multiple U-turns all within the space of a few hours.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s just remind ourselves what the truly abhorrent practice of conversion therapy involves.\u00a0\nFrom prayer to exorcisms, food deprivation to outright physical violence, this torment and torture prevents people from being their true selves, in a most inhumane and callous way.\u00a0\nAfter some seemingly warm words and vague commitments from the Government in recent months, ITV revealed on 31 March that the Government had backtracked entirely and ditched all plans to ban the practice.\nFollowing that U-turn, we saw another within hours. But this pivot was even more cowardly, as it excluded trans conversion therapy.\u00a0\u00a0\nLet\u2019s call out this farce for what it is \u2013 a cold-blooded attempt to stir up culture wars, divide communities, and drop support for some of society\u2019s most vulnerable.\u00a0\nA letter this week from the former Archbishop of Canterbury and others is calling for the inclusion of trans people in the conversion therapy ban, and more than 100 organisations have now pulled out of the Government\u2019s flagship LGBT conference this summer \u2013 a mark of shame on our nation\u2019s record of equality.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore: NewsBrit security guard accused of spying for Russia extradited from Germany\nBucha massacre shows Putin's desperation and 'should be a warning to us all'\nVladimir Putin's daughters to face sanctions from EU and US after Bucha massacreThis barely scratches the surface. I don\u2019t even have space to include the scandal of dumping raw sewage in our rivers and seas, Boris and Rishi\u2019s shameful self-isolation Covid \u2018pilot testing scheme\u2019, the apparently now \u2018impractical\u2019 plan to limit MPs\u2019 earnings from second jobs, and many more.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no plan, no structure, no strategy.\u00a0\nYou\u2019d think that with our Prime Minister\u2019s sense of arrogance and entitlement, he and his disciples would be more sure of their own opinions.\nBut this rash of U-turns reveals not only shameless cynicism, staggering incompetence and chaos \u2013 it reinforces that he and his Government cannot be trusted.\nDo you have a story you\u2019d like to share?

Images/iStockphoto)It finally got me.\u00a0\nJust over two years since the first lockdown began in the UK, the dreaded second line on the Covid test appeared for me in brilliant purple.\nUnlike the other positive test I took seven or so months ago to confirm I was pregnant, this news obviously didn\u2019t result in quite so much celebration.\u00a0\nIn fact, it was met with many tears and a lot of anxiety about what to expect.\u00a0\nIn my third trimester, trying not to catch Covid had become an almost constant preoccupation.\u00a0\nWith so much misinformation around and very little actual knowledge about how the virus might impact our unborn child, it was impossible to know what to expect.\u00a0\nBut, just before we caught it, seven of 10 couples in our antenatal course had been struck down, as well as the instructor.\nIt was absolutely everywhere \u2014 with 1 in 13 in England infected the same week as we were, according to the ONS.\u00a0\nAround the same time, the Government had recently scrapped all legal requirements to isolate even for anyone testing positive, leaving us with two options \u00a0 continue as normal and potentially catch it, or barricade ourselves at home until the spike begins to plateau.\nAt this stage of my pregnancy, with so many medical appointments to attend, option B was an impossibility.\nAnd so, like many others, we went to our appointments, we carried on going to work, we saw family and friends \u2014 and we caught Covid.\nAt first it was OK \u2013 I had symptoms, but they were manageable, and I let myself believe that maybe it really was \u2018just like a cold\u2019 once you\u2019ve had the vaccine, as some online suggest.\nNine symptoms have now been added (Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk)However, around day three, things got a lot worse for me, and I had about four days of pretty severe symptoms, where I was barely able to get out of bed, let alone carry on with work or anything else.\u00a0\nMy partner had it easier, feeling quite bad for the first few days before starting to improve around the fourth \u2014 I\u2019d chalk the difference in our experiences up to the fact I am pregnant and my body is already under so much strain.\u00a0\nImmediately after testing positive,\u00a0 we cancelled all plans and prepared to stay home for as long as it took for the virus to pass.\u00a0\nWe did this, not because we were under any legal obligation to do so, but because it was the right thing to do to try to stop the spread of a virus that is still making people very ill and killing them \u2014 and because we were able to afford any financial losses stemming from our self-imposed isolation.\u00a0\nOnce a day, we have left the house to walk round the block and get some fresh air, but have worn masks, avoided people and not entered any premises where they may be congregating.\nHopefully, we\u2019ve ensured that at least one of the little chains of virus transmissions currently hopping through friends, families and colleagues up and down the UK stops with us.\u00a0\nBut I can\u2019t shake how utterly absurd it feels that the only thing stopping us from infecting other people with this horrible virus is ourselves and our own privilege.\u00a0\nWithout our resources, then staying home to stop the spread simply wouldn\u2019t have been an option, would it?\nWalking around our community while still testing positive feels like holding a loaded gun \u2013 we have no idea of how severely someone could react if we infected them.\nAnd yet we are free to wander around putting them in acute danger if they engage in the risky behaviour of simply leaving their houses.\nThis is most frustrating when I think about all of the vulnerable people in England \u2014 be they disabled, suffering with chronic illness, elderly or yes, pregnant \u2014 who have been completely abandoned by the current government strategy.\u00a0\nOnce a day, we have left the house to walk round the block and get some fresh air (Picture: Rose Stokes)And this is before you even factor in the end of free Covid testing for most people, which coincided with some of the highest infection numbers since the pandemic began.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is entirely possible to not want lockdowns to continue, and at the same time to expect a degree of nuance in government legislation in order to combine the need for people to retain their freedom while not knowingly fanning the flame of dangerous transmission levels.\u00a0\nIt puts the burden instead on the average person \u2013 leaving them with impossible decisions to make.\u00a0\nDo they stay home and protect others, while potentially incurring a huge financial loss in doing so, or do they go out and risk infecting someone who may not recover with a disease we still don\u2019t fully understand?\nDo they spend money in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis taking a test\u00a0\u2013 or instead spend their hard earned cash on heating, food and carrying on with their lives as usual, while potentially infecting vulnerable people?\nThese are not decisions that citizens of a responsible or compassionate country should have to be making every single day, and yet we are left with no choice.\u00a0\nNo one can tell me if my unborn baby will be impacted by my brush with Covid or what the longer-term impact may be, so for now that is an anxiety I am choosing to bury deep\nAs I \u2014 like millions of other people in the country \u2014 continue to navigate these impossible decisions with little support from those responsible for our wellbeing as a nation, I can\u2019t help but feel angry.\nMore: CoronavirusLatest Covid wave 'may have peaked' in children and young adults\nWhere can you travel unvaccinated?\nMore Covid deaths likely in coming weeks after record surge, experts warnAngry that the health of so many is seemingly a secondary priority behind Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to save his own skin by appealing to his own MPs by ending restrictions.\nAngry that in making the morally correct decision not to infect other people, many people will need to incur significant financial losses at a time of great economic struggle.\u00a0\nAngry that the Government is playing such a dangerous game with people\u2019s lives.\nTwo years on from the onset of the pandemic, it may seem reasonable to expect that we would have moved beyond such a reckless gamble.\u00a0 And that lessons may have been learned.\nSadly though, looking around at the current state of things, even through a haze of Covid and pregnancy, I can only conclude that nothing could be further from the truth.\nDo you have a story you\u2019d like to share?

Internet is typically $45 a month, bringing the total to around $1,300.\nAnd what do you get for what you pay?\nIt\u2019s a studio, but it feels less claustrophobic because the kitchen is separated and there is also a separate changing area. There are three closets technically (including one walk-in) and one bathroom.\nI also get access to the building\u2019s incredible rooftop that overlooks the lake \u2013 it\u2019s my favorite view of the city. There is also a mini grocery store, gym, business center with printers and sparkling water/coffee machines in the lobby.\nShe lives alone in a studio flat in Chicago (Picture: Saverio Truglia/Metro.co.uk)Do you think you have a good deal?\nI do! It\u2019s small, but for the location and amenities, I don\u2019t think you could get any cheaper. I actually thought it was a scam the first time I saw the listing.BILLS: Compare & Save\nEnergyQuickly compare your energy and save an average of \u00a3216\nBroadbandCompare broadband, phone & TV packages\nISAVisit AJ Bell Youinvest to find out more about their low-cost ISA\nMobileCompare mobile contract and SIM only deals\nCar InsuranceGet a quote today and see how much you could save with Confused.comWhereabouts is your apartment based? What do you think of the area?\nMy apartment is in Gold Coast in Chicago. I think it\u2019s the most beautiful area in the city. \nIt\u2019s right next to the lake and has a lot of historic, beautiful homes. \nYou can walk just about anywhere yet it\u2019s quieter than some of the surrounding neighborhoods.\nRent is $1, 245 a month (Picture: Saverio Truglia/Metro.co.uk)How did you find this property?\nIt was through one of the online apartments listings, I believe apartment.com.\nHow have you made the apartment feel like home?\nI think a place really starts to feel like \u2018you\u2019 in the details. \nIt\u2019s the little things, like pictures of my grandparents and my favorite books that bring me a lot of comfort. \nI also think plants and flowers can make a place feel extra homey.\nHave you found it difficult to decorate when renting and sharing a place? Is your landlord happy with you doing bits?\nNope! I\u2019ve never let renting hold me back in how I decorate. You can always paint something back or fill in nail holes. \nMy landlord is on a need-to-know basis, but I always get my apartments back to their original states before moving out.\nThe studio is just 525 sq ft (Picture: Saverio Truglia/Metro.co.uk)You\u2019ve got such a distinct style when it comes to interiors \u2013 tell us a bit about that.\nI grew up in a family of girls \u2013 two sisters, almost all girl cousins and lots of aunts so everything in my life has always been ultra feminine. \nMy mom was my first introduction to design \u2013 she\u2019s an incredible designer. She and my dad flip and build houses so I got my love of DIY from them.\nI trace a lot of my style back to my childhood. I had amazing grandmas and great aunts who gave us girls a magical childhood and made us really believe we were princesses for a while. \nWe spent a lot of time playing in my grandma\u2019s rose garden, having tea parties and wearing fluffy dresses so I have nods to rosebuds and gardens in my decor.\nMy love of pink started early. It was my \u2018assigned\u2019 color out of my sisters growing up (theirs being purple and blue). \nI also studied ballet at the Kansas City School of Ballet for 13 years and naturally there is a lot of pink associated with it. \nI\u2019ve never really been a neutral gal \u2013 I find I instantly love the things I own more, whether that\u2019s clothing or decor, if they are in happy colors and patterns that feel authentic to me.\nBut Haley reckons she\u2019s got a good deal (Picture: Saverio Truglia/Metro.co.uk)And you\u2019ve done some DIY projects, too, right?\nYes! I recently wallpapered my fridge (it\u2019s removable)! \nI really love removable wallpaper, and it has so many use cases, whether you\u2019re renting or just aren\u2019t ready to fully commit to something. \nI once had a kitchen table in this apartment that I turned the top of light blue with removable wallpaper because I couldn\u2019t commit to paint.\nA lot of other items in here are also DIY! I found my vanity on Facebook Marketplace and painted it and replaced the handles. \nThat\u2019s also where I found my purple squiggle lamp \u2013 I painted it, too, and switched the lampshade. \nA few of the ceramic items around here (plates and vases) I made at a ceramic shop, which is super fun.\nDo you feel like you have enough space?\nI have 525 square feet, but it has served me well for two years. Sometimes I kind of enjoy how small it is \u2013 it\u2019s just me and all of my favorite things.\nThat said, I will be looking for more space in my next place. I\u2019d love more rooms to decorate!\nYou\u2019ll spot a lot of pink in this place (Picture: Saverio Truglia/Metro.co.uk)Are there any problems with the apartment you have to deal with? Tell us about the not-so-great bits. \nTruthfully, there\u2019s really not much to note! I\u2019m not a fan of the carpet I have in my apartment, but the new units have hardwood. I love my building staff. Shockingly, I get no noise from neighbors. I\u2019ve been really happy here.\nMore: RentingWhat I Rent: Assia and Jack, \u00a3925 a month for a room in a shared house in Clapton, London\nWhat I Rent: Michael and Leo, \u00a31,400 a month for a one-bedroom flat in Richmond, London\nHow to ask your landlord to let you do DIY in a rented home\nWhat I Rent: Scarlett and Xandice, \u00a31,050 a month for a two-bedroom flat in BrightonDo you have plans to move again any time soon?\nI do!

Enmeshment.\nWhat is enmeshment?\nEnmeshment is the term used in psychology to describe an \u2018extreme overinvolvement and intense bond and closeness with a significant other at the expense of healthy individual identity and social functioning,\u2019 Dr Steven Mahan, clinical psychologist and operational lead at The Chelsea Psychology Clinic, tells Metro.co.uk.\nEnmeshment can happen in any kind of relationship, from a friendship, to a parent relationship, and, of course, a romantic relationship.\n\u2018A person who is enmeshed with a significant other may struggle to function on their own or make their own choices without seeking constant support, reassurance, and/or validation, and have a desperate need to be emotionally close to their significant other,\u2019 continues Mahan.\n\u2018A person who is enmeshed with a significant other may struggle to function on their own\u2019 (Picture: Getty)\u2018In extreme cases they may believe they cannot survive without the enmeshed relationship.\u2019\nIt\u2019s important to note that being enmeshed is not the same as simply being emotionally close to another person; it\u2019s much more unhealthy and is usually characterised by a complete lack of independence for both parties.\nAs Mahan explains, we can feel extremely close to someone in a healthy way without feeling we do not have our own unique needs, identity, goals and ambitions.\nWhat are the main signs that you\u2019re becoming enmeshed?\nWhen a relationship has become enmeshed, there is a complete lack of healthy boundaries, and a partner\u2019s needs are always prioritised above your own.\nOne sign, says Mahan, is \u2018obsessively holding in mind their significant other\u2019s thoughts, feelings, behaviours and wishes,\u2019 while also all views, wishes and desires that are not consistent with the significant other\u2019s.\u00a0\nPeople who are enmeshed might mimic the behaviours and opinions of their significant other, which explains why some people may uncharacteristically change their view on a topic to match their partner\u2019s.\u00a0\nAt this point, any disagreement from your partner will feel like a genuine attack or an indication that they no longer love you.\n\u2018Enmeshment prevents our ability to feel confident and safe whilst being autonomous in our own behaviours and decisions\u2019 (Picture: Getty)Usually in an enmeshed relationship, one will have a \u2018frequent or near constant contact with the significant other,\u2019 says Mahan.\n\u2018And, in extreme cases, other relationships may be sacrificed in favour of maintaining the bond with their significant other,\u2019 he adds.\u00a0\nIt probably goes without saying then that enmeshment is toxic: \u2018Enmeshment prevents our ability to feel confident and safe whilst being autonomous in our own behaviours and decisions,\u2019 says Mahan.\u00a0\n\u2018It starves us of a willingness to pursue our own interests and will inevitably result in emotional dysregulation and an impaired ability to cope with and tolerate distress.\u2019\nSo, once you\u2019ve become enmeshed, is there any chance of going back?\nHow to separate yourself from a significant other without breaking up\nIf you\u2019ve realised that you\u2019ve become enmeshed, but you don\u2019t feel that ending the relationship is necessary, it\u2019s important to remember that you can get your independence back.\n\u2018In order for a relationship to result in healthy closeness, it is vital that both people maintain a unique and independent identity, pursuing their own interests and activities,\u2019 says Mahan.\n\u2018Independence and autonomy is good \u2013 having a healthy level of independence and individual identity is an extremely positive aspect of a relationship, and to feel guilty for wanting or needing this is unfair on yourself.\u2019\nHere are some steps you can take to stop being enmeshed:\nBe open\nSpeaking openly about how you feel, as long as you feel safe to do so, is a vital first step in finding yourself again.\u00a0\n\u2018This creates a space for openness and conversation and promotes an understanding of what is going on for you,\u2019 says Mahan.\n\u2018This allows you to express your feelings and to reassure others that to explore your own identity does not mean you love or care for them any less.\u2019\nSet boundaries\n\u2018Learning to set boundaries to create physical and emotional space is vital for a healthy relationship,\u2019 says Mahan.\u00a0\n\u2018Being clear about what you need and why with both yourself and your significant other will help you both navigate and understand your needs.\u2019\nThis can be as simple as having an hour a day where you do something just for you, or going out with your friends without your partner being with you.\nGet to know yourself\nPeople who are enmeshed might not have a very strong sense of self, which is vital if you want to be your own person.\u00a0\n\u2018Exploring activities that pique your interest, or just activities you have never done before, could be a good place to start to explore what interests you,\u2019 says Mahan.\n\u2018Try a new hobby, explore a new restaurant, see what events are happening in your local area and attend alone or with people other than the person you are enmeshed with.\u2019\nThere\u2019s no need to rush this step, as getting out of your comfort zone might be daunting or intimidating.\u00a0\nMahan adds that, when you do engage in independent activities, it\u2019s important to focus on the present moment rather than wondering about your significant other.\n\u2018Remember, you will see them again soon and it is positive to be doing activities and pursuing interests outside of the relationship,\u2019 he says.\u00a0\nPsychological therapy\nFinally, it might be a good idea to seek professional help.\nThis is because the roots of enmeshment often stem from traumatic experiences in childhood and problematic relationships from a young age.\u00a0\n\u2018Exploring this with a qualified mental health professional can be invaluable in understanding why having autonomy in relationships can be such a challenge for you,\u2019 says Mahan.\u00a0\nMore: Mental healthI hid my sexuality at work after experiencing biphobia from colleagues\nBrits are

A friend of mine suggested I could do some webcamming \u2013 performing sex acts on video and internet live streams. \nTo begin with, I genuinely didn\u2019t even know what that was. I did some research and found Adult Work, a platform I\u2019m on now. \nWhile I was scared to be starting from scratch at 44-years-old, I had no money and no job so I knew I had to go for it. Just one month later, I was bringing in a really decent wage just camming part time.\nWithin months people were asking whether I did dominatrix work, so I began thinking about whether I\u2019d want to see clients face to face, and decided to invest in proper lessons so I could learn how to be a dominatrix safely.\nSandy learned the tricks of the trade by going to dominatrix school (Source: Sandy Star/MikeFFPhoto)I went to the London Dominatrix School in Marylebone. Taking place in an immaculate apartment, the course was taught by someone who was really experienced and had been in the business for many years.\u00a0\nI paid \u00a3200 an hour for three or four lessons, which included corporate punishment and impact play, where you learn how to hit the body safely while still causing discomfort. I also learned shibari, which is the art of bondage tying, and then I learned some cock and ball torture. It was best to learn in a safe, controlled environment and be taught by a professional.\nSandy found the transition to face to face bookings difficult (Source: Sandy Star)Transitioning from webcam to face-to-face bookings was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever done.\u00a0\nOne reason was because the fetish industry gets such a bad rap \u2013 people who don\u2019t understand think it\u2019s weird and disgusting. And there was definitely fear going from just sitting on my bed, doing webcam here and there and then being in front of someone in a new setting surrounded by equipment, offering a service they pay a lot of money for. But I was lucky that the people I learned from were industry gurus in their own right, and I picked things up quite quickly.\nI charge \u00a3170 for an hour, or \u00a3250 for 90 minutes. The most common thing that clients ask for is \u2018tie and tease\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s usually restraining and blindfolding with some sensual play. I\u2019m not considered an extreme dominatrix \u2013 a lot of people who come to me just want to try it out. I often combine the more traditional domme services with more sensual routines because a lot of clients are still uncertain and want to try it out.\nSandy has a lot of equipment to stimulate her clients (Source: Sandy Star/MikeFFPhoto)Another popular service with clients is strap-on sex. Some men like anal sex and anal play, and may be scared to ask their wives. There\u2019s that element of shame around it: men don\u2019t ask because they don\u2019t want to be seen as gay. But they\u2019re not gay \u2013 they don\u2019t want anal sex from a man, they want it from a hot woman. They want to see my boobs and my face and my body.\nSome men just feel like they couldn\u2019t ask their wife to put a strap-on on, because she\u2019s the mother of their kids and they just don\u2019t see her in that way.\u00a0\nAs someone who has had kids, I do understand that your child becomes a priority. Men are needier than we think they are, and they feel a bit neglected. Women can also lose confidence after having a baby, and that can be another turn off.\nSandy says that her services actually help marriages keep afloat (Source: Sandy Star)I\u2019d say 80% of my clients are married or in relationships. I think some women would be horrified if they knew what some of their husbands are doing. Some wouldn\u2019t he able to handle their other half dressing up in another women\u2019s underwear and receiving anal pleasure. It\u2019s alien to vanilla relationships. It\u2019s hugely frowned upon and unaccepted, and it\u2019s something that stays under the radar a lot of the time.\nSome clients have told me that seeing me is keeping their marriage going. I don\u2019t know if their wives would quite see it that way. Some also say their wives know that they come to me. \nAs a general rule, I don\u2019t ask about their personal life, and I don\u2019t tell them about mine. I keep the boundaries quite clear.\nThe age of my clients range from quite young to men in their mid seventies. As I\u2019ve got an adult son myself, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s right for me to go below a certain age. I draw the line at 28, but I have had boys as young as 21 try and book me. \nSandy has experienced bizarre encounters in the fetish world (Source: Sandy Star)I would say I\u2019ve probably got five semi regular clients between the age of 65 and 75. I find elderly gentlemen tend to be a lot more respectful and polite. They\u2019re my preferred client, if I\u2019m honest.\nYou absolutely need friends in the industry when you\u2019re doing this, as some days can get weird pretty quickly. I had an extreme submissive once that said he wanted me to put a plastic bag over his head and be suffocated.\nI\u2019ve had muscle worship sessions, where people really like muscly women and they like to be dominated in a headlock or I might arm wrestle them. \nMore: SexEV charger hacked with very fruity content on display instead of council website\n'My girlfriend won't have sex before marriage - is this just an excuse?'\nCan you have sex during Ramadan?Once I did it to a client and he suddenly went limp. It was quite a hot day and he just fainted, so I snapped my fingers in his face and he quickly came round, saying he didn\u2019t really realise what had happened. There\u2019s definitely occasions where things don\u2019t go to plan and it can completely throw you off your script.\nI do want to start a mentoring women in this industry so I can help them have the same positive experience I\u2019ve had. \nMy advice for anyone considering it is to not be frightened to say no. If you\u2019re not comfortable doing something, don\u2019t do it. And just enjoy it. The last three years have been crazy: I\u2019ve built a six figure industry from being a dominatrix, and I want more women to feel empowered while doing it.\u2019\n\t\t\t\tSmut Drop\t\t\tSmut Drop is a weekly podcast with hosts Jackie Adedeji and Miranda Kane from Metro.co.uk, touching on sex, dating and relationships. \nWith no holds barred, it\u2019s the home of sex positive chat, where our hosts will be joined each week with sexperts and special guests to explore the world of the erotic. \nAnd we want to hear from you, too!

A better experience.\u00a0\n\u2018I started Exhale so Black women would not feel alone, so they could see themselves reflected.\u00a0Sometimes it can feel like the things you are feeling at work are in your head, or you might be imagining it. \n\u2018Then you share it in this space and you realise that you are not the only one, and that is so powerful.\u2019\n\u2018I started Exhale so Black women would not feel alone\u2019 (Picture: Tray Agyeman)This is the second year of Exhale. Natalie Alleyne, a writer and mentor, went last year and says the experience was transformational.\n\u2018It was beyond what I had hoped,\u2019 Natalie tells Metro.co.uk. \u2018It was very restorative. We did activities like painting and capoeira which were cathartic, when you release the stress, inspiration can be let in. \n\u2018We explored how we can support each other in the third sector, how we can do our best work\u00a0\u00a0while protecting our mental health. The retreat was intergenerational, so it was brilliant to have older and younger women sharing experiences and support.\u2019\nTray says having women attend of all different ages and generations was very important to her to provide a wide variety of experience and wisdom. \n\u2018They share what they have learned or face at work and are able to provide support to others,\u2019 says Tray.\n\u2018Black women joy is the underpinning theme\u2019 (Picture: Tray Agyeman)\u2018Last year\u2019s event was inexplicable. Someone said, and it will stay with me forever, that the retreat was not something you can describe, you can only experience it.\n\u2018Women came from different parts of the country and across the three days they shared lessons learned, tools, coping mechanisms, laughs and stories and experiences.\u00a0\n\u2018Black women joy is the underpinning theme, and the retreat encourages attendees to be present, and to just \u201cbe\u201d without having to perform.\u2019\nNatalie says she learned important lessons and experienced an overwhelming sense of understanding and support.\n\u2018We are all more than the colour of our skin, more than our gender, or sexual preferences, or physical ability and whatever else \u2013 on paper these things don\u2019t limit our ability to connect with each other or to be free,\u2019 she says. \u2018But, in a society that is accustomed to a white male dominant culture, us other folk are often perceived through a lens that misunderstands us and ascribes us negative stereotypes that can make navigating elements of life challenging.\n\u2018The retreat is a safe space where the additional burdens we face are known as fact, and so we can exist for a while without the additional burdens.\u2019\n\u2018It is the breathing room and safety that every human deserves\u2019 (Picture: Tray Agyeman)Tray says\u00a0the first retreat last year taught her just how much this type of space is desperately needed by so many. This year, she is making a few changes to the lineup.\n\u2018We are inviting more women and we are bringing in workshop leaders to guide attendees into sessions,\u2019 she explains. \n\u2018There are sessions which are creative, therapeutic as well as laid back for those moments you just want to exhale. I want to build on the sisterhood that was created and support even more women with their career and aspirations.\u2019\nMore: HealthThese are the six core personality traits that highly sensitive people possess\nMan in agony after misdiagnosed eczema says water feels like acid on his skin\nBrits are 'more exhausted than ever before' - over a third are on the brink of burnout\nWhat is the 15 minute sleep rule?For Natalie, Exhale is the space she has been looking for her whole life. \n\u2018It is the breathing room and safety that every human deserves and I believe it should be a permanent space,\u2019 she says.\n\u2018When you remove the excessive societal pressure and scrutiny that Black women face just for being Black women, we have room to excel. Our energy is no longer split between worry or fear over how we are perceived and potentially chastised, failed, ignored. \n\u2018We can support each other and heal, just thrive and ultimately get the job done with wellness and full aptitude \u2013 whatever that job may be.\u2019\nDo you have a story to share?\nGet in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.\n\tMORE : These are the best books to read about the environment and climate change\n\tMORE : A third of Black, Asian and mixed-race workers have left a job because of \u2018a lack of flexibility\u2019\n\tMORE : The pressure of being a young activist drove me to burnout and depression "}, {"images": [{"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SEI_97537160.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=964%2C506", "alt": "Retreat for Black women aims to 'heal racial exhaustion' and create space for joy Credit Getty / metro.co.uk"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26879F08-60AA-4F7F-99C4-2721E3F6A1CD-5e6d.jpeg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=768%2C421", "alt": "The gardens of the retreat"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/EFC2F1BC-F454-49BC-9EE0-A82694BAB242-0962-e1649338710878.jpeg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=768%2C440", "alt": "woman painting"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/579C961E-C863-4D6F-BD7C-96BC69180A7A-4603.jpeg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=601%2C463", "alt": "woman playing tamborine"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1211578421-6b9a-e1649324484574.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=61px%2C0px%2C1178px%2C884px&resize=480%2C360&zoom=1", "alt": "zone post image for post 16422211"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SEC_97551640.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=480&h=360&crop=1&zoom=1", "alt": "zone post image for post 16423276"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1164339481.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=232px%2C0px%2C1887px%2C1415px&resize=480%2C360&zoom=1", "alt": "zone post image for post 16421027"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-820818020-557b.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=480&h=360&crop=1&zoom=1", "alt": "zone post image for post 16404538"}]}]}, {"url": "https://metro.co.uk/2022/04/07/heres-how-men-can-make-women-feel-safe-and-comfortable-on-dates-16423558/", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Here\u2019s how men can make women feel safe and comfortable on dates"}, {"author_container": "Jessica Lindsay"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 16:21:00"}, {"article_body": "\nIf your both feel secure, you can get to know each other without distractions (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Before a first date, you\u2019re likely worrying about what to wear and hoping there\u2019s chemistry.\nFor women who date men, these jitters are tinged with something darker; the fear that the person you\u2019re meeting up with may be pushy, aggressive, or even violent.\nThese fears aren\u2019t unfounded. British backpacker Grace Millane was murdered in New Zealand by a Tinder date. Usha Patel was beaten to death in her home by a man she met online, all while her child slept upstairs. Teacher Katie Locke was subjected to a \u2018forceful and prolonged\u2019 attack before being killed by her PlentyOfFish date.\nGranted, there are thousands of meet-ups that pass without incident, and far more men who would never dream of committing such acts. From a woman\u2019s perspective, however, the risk of things turning nasty are never zero.\nEven if you\u2019re the most placid guy around, it shouldn\u2019t be up to your date to try and decode your behaviour. As a respectful person, you should always prioritise a partner\u2019s safety \u2013 and as a man, that means acknowledging why they may feel vulnerable.\nBut stopping short of actively saying you aren\u2019t dangerous (ruining the vibe and sounding very much like you are) what can men actually do to ensure the women they\u2019re dating feel comfortable?\nElaine Parker, founder of\u00a0Safer\u00a0Date,\u00a0tells Metro.co.uk: \u2018With all of the horror stories out there, it\u2019s important to strike the right balance and to make your\u00a0date\u00a0feel comfortable and safe, while still having fun.\u2019\nShe\u2019s shared her top tips for men to bridge that gap, so you can get to know each other while showing that you respect their boundaries.\nPlanning a date\nWhen it comes to choosing a first date spot, the best place is somewhere that\u2019s public and easily accessible for both of you.\nElaine says: \u2018Try meeting halfway so that both you and your\u00a0date\u00a0can get there and back again safely without being stranded. \n\u2018You might feel pressure choosing a venue yourself, so why not collaborate on where to go? Being conscious of your\u00a0date\u2019s preferences will help you choose somewhere you\u2019re both comfortable with.\u2019\nGo for a public place when you first meet, and choose something casual so you\u2019re not restricted by time (Picture: Getty)Big romantic gestures can be lovely, but may come across as \u2018love bombing\u2019 in the early stages of a relationship. \nSimilarly, surprise locations or events where your date can\u2019t easily leave if things don\u2019t go to plan (like private dinners) should be kept until you know each other better.\nThe obvious answer is to go for a drink, but there are plenty of options if you\u2019d prefer to keep things alcohol-free, from go-karting and rock-climbing to a coffee and a stroll around the park.\nThe date itself\nThe first thing Elaine suggests when it comes to meeting up is to be on time \u2013 mainly because it\u2019s common courtesy to do so.\nShe also argues against the trope that men should bring a gift to a first date, saying: \u2018As endearing as you think it might seem, avoid taking flowers or a gift with you, since it may be seen as an instant red flag.\u2019\nTV and films have sold us the idea that men in heterosexual couples should woo the women they\u2019re seeing with grand displays of affection, despite such peacocking coming across as arrogant or formulaic in reality.\nAllaying fears that you\u2019re reading from a pickup artistry playbook \u2013 and avoiding awkward lulls in conversation \u2013 is as simple as listening and asking.\nListening to \u2013 and being curious about \u2013 your date shows you\u2019re serious about them (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Elaine says: \u2018Keep it cool to help calm both of your nerves by asking interesting questions. After all, you need to test the water to see if they\u2019re the right person for you. \n\u2018Are they family orientated? Any hobbies outside of work? Maybe you have similar music taste, what\u2019s their favourite album? \n\u2018The most important part of all of this is to listen. Chances are you\u2019ll pick up on other things that you\u2019d like to know more about, resulting in great conversation.\u2019 \nAt the end of the date\nIt\u2019s the well-worn question that\u2019s eluded daters across the globe; should a man automatically pick up the bill for a date?\nElaine says: \u201921st century dating has moved far away from traditional methods where the male would pay for the bill. \n\u2018Although it can be incredibly flattering to pay for the\u00a0date, make a judgement call. If your\u00a0date\u00a0offers to half the bill, don\u2019t be offended. It\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u2019\nSome women may merely want to pay their share, but others see going Dutch as a way to restore the power imbalance. Even though we know no one is \u2018owed\u2019 anything for covering the tab, not every dater shares the same viewpoint.\nIt\u2019s also worth broaching the topic of a potential second date while on the first. Whether you\u2019re feeling it or not, Elaine advises being \u2018open and honest\u2019 and never ghosting.\nMore: LifestyleWhy is delayed gratification so hot?\nHow to ask your landlord to let you do DIY in a rented home\nFirefighters cut woman's stuck wedding ring off as her finger began to turn blue\u2018It could be as simple as a considerate message or an open conversation about how you\u2019re feeling,\u2019 she says. \u2018Whether\u00a0online or offline, nobody likes being left in the dark wondering what happened.\u2019\nElaine continues: \u2018Finally, make sure your\u00a0date\u00a0gets home safely.

He said terrible things, but we all make mistakes.\u2019\nSince winning the PGA Championship last year, Mickelson\u2019s popularity has fallen like a stone and many sponsors have cut ties with the American following a phone conversation he took with golf writer Alan Shipnuck.\nIn an excerpt to be released in a new book next month, Mickelson describes the Saudis as \u2018scary mother****ers\u2019 to get involved with and suggested his support for the breakaway league was to force the PGA Tour\u2019s hand to give more money to players.\nLast month, following the revelations, he issued an apology via his management team where wished to put the issue behind him.\nMore: GolfAll eyes on Tiger Woods but America's next generation primed for Masters glory\nRory McIlroy responds to Tiger Woods Masters comeback speculation\nTiger Woods plays full round at Augusta ahead of possible Masters comebackHe said: \u2018Although it doesn\u2019t look this way now given my recent comments, my actions throughout this process have always been with the best interest of golf, my peers, sponsors, and fans.\n\u2018There is the problem of off-record comments being shared out of context and without my consent, but the bigger issue is that I used words I sincerely regret that do not reflect my true feelings or intentions.\n\u2018It was reckless, I offended people, and I am deeply sorry for my choice of words.

Each team has had to completely revamp its car design for 2022 with F1 altering its rules in an effort to allow cars to follow one another more easily and for drivers to race each other harder.\nCharles Leclerc and Max Verstappen\u2019s terrific, tactical tussles for the lead during first two races of the campaign in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have shown that the new cars are indeed fulfilling their purpose. \nBut with a car which is suffering from intense bouncing at high speed on the straights, and which is simply slower than its rivals through the corners, Hamilton and team-mate George Russell are competing for midfield points rather than race victories.\nTeam principal Toto Wolff broached the team\u2019s poor form in his preview of the Australian race, writing: \u2018At the moment, our track performance is not meeting our own expectations, but everyone at Brackley and Brixworth is focused on understanding the problems and finding the right solutions.\nMore: Lewis HamiltonGeorge Russell and Toto Wolff issue Mercedes warning ahead of Australian Grand Prix\nRed Bull chief rates Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes' chances of winning F1 title\nMax Verstappen wants full FIwants FIA report into Abu Dhabi F1 controversy kept hidden\u2018There won\u2019t be a magic fix for the next race weekend, but we\u2019re pushing to steadily bring gains over the upcoming races, to hopefully move us closer to the front of the pack.

Either way, totally ship it (Picture: BBC)When you think about Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), the last emotion you would link to her is love and adoration. But, despite everything, the queen of mean, the heart of ice with added spice, the Butcher of men seems to have found a way to fall for Mick Carter (Danny Dyer).\nAnd honestly, while EastEnders has always sold Mick and his wife Linda (Kellie Bright) as the Walford power couple who can never be divided (well, except for the four hundred odd times they already have been), I am switching teams.\nLinda and Mick had a good run, but Janine is now the woman for him as far as I am concerned. And I am happy to die on this hill \u2013 well until she pushes Mick down it while he is wearing slip on shoes.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I loved Mick and Linda as a couple but they have simply been put through far too much at this stage for them to legitimately operate happily.\nFor me, the last straw came when Linda was pouring more than pints for sewer rat Max Branning while her clearly suffering husband was dealing with haunted memories of child abuse.\nYeuch, Linda lost a lot for me through that.\nSo much tension \u2013 and not the good kind (Picture: BBC)Additionally, the pair are ready to think the worst of each other without, I don\u2019t know, sending a WhatsApp or, seemingly archaically, picking up the phone and asking what is actually going on.\nCommunication is key to a marriage and Mick and Linda have had more secrets than Area 51. Screeching each other apart reaches a point when a relationship can take no more and I am frankly exhausted with them ripping shreds from each other.\nJanine may dupe rich, older husbands down the aisle despite being \u2018as Jewish as a bacon sandwich\u2019, she may frame others for the stabbing of her vindictive lover (and even herself on one occasion) and she may even role play with Ian Beale (bleach my brain), but somehow she is seeming like a semi-decent person.\nNot for the first time, Mick and Linda are as estranged as can be when they need one another, so Janine has been there in the wake of Tina\u2019s death.\nDoes Janine\u2026care!? (Picture: BBC)Janine has been there for Mick when he needs her (Picture: BBC)And boy, do these two have chemistry \u2013 I am talking Kat and Alfie behind the bar chemistry and maybe even drifting close to the Sharon and Dennis Snr vibe.\nThey bounce off each other well; there has been mischief and it has awoken the side of Mick I have missed a lot \u2013 lots of banter and a real spark in his personality.\nBut even ahead of that is the, dare I say, moving scenes of Janine being his pillar. Usually, Janine wants something such as money or revenge when she acts as this kind of pillar \u2013 which she is just getting ready to crumble and send the person it is holding up crashing to the ground.\nAfter they had a stroll together away from the bustle of Walford, there was a real feeling of unity there and Janine truly cared. Or she is putting on the act of her life, anyway.\nTruly, I felt a new depth to Janine not often seen and Mick was able to let himself go and scream into the void as she provided that safe space for him to let loose.\nAnd, to top it all off, she bought him some chips. That is true love, coming from someone who likes to relieve someone of their money rather than contribute her own readies.\nLook, it\u2019s pretty obvious there is no happy ending on the cards; Mick is leaving so any romance with either Janine or Linda is doomed.\nAnd it seems fairly likely that the Janine of old won\u2019t be able to help herself if Mick so much as raises an eyebrow in the wrong way towards her.\nBut it\u2019s so much more fun; there\u2019s fire and energy and while Kellie has been absolutely phenomenal (when is she not?), it\u2019s hard to see Mick and Linda as anything but mutually destructive now.\nYes, the anger and breakdowns are born from the ache of genuine and lost love, but there is just no way back and I can\u2019t see the point in EastEnders writing in a strained reunion before Mick leaves.\nI am far more into the cat fights between Linda and Janine, the sassy dialogue and top tier performances from titans Charlie and Kellie.\nThis feels like true EastEnders \u2013 a sizzling couple behind the bar, public slanging matches and a build up to what has been promised as an explosive ending.\nMick has been in need of a new oomph in his life and while Linda may always be his soulmate, Janine has invigorated everything.\nClassic EastEnders \u2013 these are the scenes we want (Picture: BBC)It has added such great depth to Janine since her welcome return \u2013 would she have worked if she was just an all out superbitch, surely the temptation when bringing back a character like that?\nEmmerdale tried that with Kim Tate, who is now so much more watchable as a schemer but with much more vulnerability.\nI haven\u2019t been invested in a story in Walford like this for at least a year and suddenly everything is moving in the right and exciting way.\nNow all I need is to find out where returning Sam Mitchell will find herself \u2013 I hope to be writing a similar piece about her fiery scenes with anyone in her orbit before long.\n\tMORE : EastEnders spoilers: Linda destroyed as Mick drops Janine bombshell on her\n\tMORE : EastEnders spoilers: Violent attack, death tragedy and shock proposal The Soaps NewsletterSign upIncludes exclusive content, spoilers and interviews before they're seen on the site.

I felt this when I watched Embarrassing Bodies for the first time.\u00a0\nI was in my early teens and too scared to even look at my nipples in case I found a hair or realised that actually I didn\u2019t have holes in them.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, my anus was a shadowy mystery and my vulva\u00a0was\u00a0She Who Must Not Be Named (or looked at, definitely not looked at). I was petrified of being abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo imagine how my face fell when I turned on the TV and found a woman staring at her vulva in exasperation saying, \u2018It\u2019s not normal!\u2019 Ah, TURN IT OFF. I don\u2019t want to know!\u00a0\nI carried on with life and almost forgot about the show. Until I saw Naked Attraction in 2016.\u00a0\nIf you haven\u2019t seen it before, Naked Attraction aims to flip the premise of dating on its head. One lucky guy or gal picks their date based\u00a0solely\u00a0on their body. And then with all the hehe out the way, they consummate their attraction with a date. Like all dating shows, it rarely works.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut when I first set eyes on it, I knew I couldn\u2019t look away.\u00a0\nUnlike when watching Embarrassing Bodies, by the time Naked Attraction rolled around I\u2019d seen female nakedness before \u2013 of course! I\u2019m not a prude! It\u2019s everywhere.\u00a0\nI knew I needed to see more normal bodies (Picture: Channel 4)Porn being the most explicit place, where no one has hair or labia. Then there\u2019s films with nipples but not the peen; perfume adverts; hell \u2013 even yogurt ads are sometimes spicy. But whatever they are selling, sex or mouldy cheese (or both), these aesthetic portrayals are hardly cultural emblems for the average British woman.\u00a0\nSo, as a university fuelled-feminist, I knew I needed to see more normal bodies. It\u2019s because of this I put my grievances (aka face in stomach feeling) aside and watched this trashy new show.\u00a0\nTo my pleasant surprise, I found that unlike Embarrassing Bodies, this was just\u2026 bodies. I found that MY BOOBS ARE BETTER THAN HERS! FANTASTIC! (I am trying to improve). And just like that, my long-term body anxiety was eased.\u00a0\u00a0\nThey didn\u2019t tell us this in school, I remember thinking.\u00a0\nOf course, we can seek out sex education on social media and with a quick Google\u00a0search\u00a0that will tell us \u2018every boob and vagina is different\u2019. But until I saw (moderately) different boobs and vulvas thrust in my face on national television, I didn\u2019t truly believe it.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Naked Attraction isn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t claim to be \u2018culturally significant\u2019 or \u2018artistically important\u2019 \u2013 something uppity, oh-so-clever-and-sarcastic Tweets failed to understand yesterday when they used the show to encapsulate the quality\u00a0of\u00a0Channel 4 as a whole in reaction to the news that it is to be privatised.\u00a0\nIn a hilarious scroll I even saw someone calling Naked Attraction \u2018salacious\u2019 \u2013 a word that dates back to the 17th century.\u00a0\nI couldn\u2019t comprehend their disdain for this show, which to me is such an important watch.\u00a0\nBut equally, those who\u2019ve hit back and said\u00a0Naked\u00a0Attraction is a \u2018cultural jewel\u2019 are liars.\nIt clearly isn\u2019t. It is titillating, technicolour trash. It\u2019s garbage because it\u2019s taboo. It\u2019s taboo because we never get to see real unedited, non-performative human bodies on screen, so it\u2019s kind of funny.\nBut it\u2019s done more for nakedness than any \u2018high-brow\u2019 director has, with his tilted hat and male-tinted glasses.\u00a0\u00a0\nI\u2019m not saying that it is the most diverse programme in the world. Certainly, the contestants all somewhat adhere to the definition of what we\u2019ve been told is reasonably \u2018normal\u2019.\u00a0\nBut in a world where,\u00a0according to a 2020 survey,\u00a057% of adults reported \u2018rarely\u2019 or \u2018never\u2019 seeing themselves or people who look like them regularly reflected in images in media and advertising, it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\nMore: Channel 4EastEnders' Matt Lapinskas cast in Hollyoaks for special Mallorca episodes\nNadine Mulkerrin stuns fans with new hair transformation as she swaps soap bun for a short\nNaked Attraction viewers in hysterics by contestant 'lured in' by 'jet-washed' vaginaIf we do not see diverse bodies in mainstream media then we have a big insecurity problem, Britain. And insecurity bubbles into nastiness. The people on Twitter playing \u2018willy or belly button\u2019 with Naked Attraction contestants are the same ones who loathe themselves. Those who laugh at contestants should strive to have the balls to do the same.\u00a0\u00a0\nI\u2019d rather eat my eyes than appear nude on national television, or even share a photo of my stretch marks. Perhaps I\u2019m a hypocrite.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut wouldn\u2019t it be nice if I could? Then perhaps I would be able to silence teenage me for good.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo whoever buys Channel 4, I say long live Naked Attraction.\u00a0\u00a0\nTurn your nose up all you like, but sometimes you can find value in the trashiest of places.

Finally! The media is spotlighting the real issues my community faces: Chronic government underfunding, systemic ableism and inaccessibility!\u2019\nExcept, the documentary wasn\u2019t about any of that.\nA World Without Dwarfism? \u2013 presented by Paralympian Ellie Simmonds \u2013 is about Vosoritide, a new once-daily injective drug hailed by some as an important treatment for achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism.\nVosoritide is available in the US and is currently being clinically trialled in the UK. It is for children with achondroplasia from the age of five, in some cases younger, until their growth platelets close, usually their early teenage years.\nBiomarin, the American inventors of the drug, say studies have shown that Vosoritide can make people who have achondroplasia taller than the 4ft average we usually grow to.\nSome in the programme expressed hope that the drug could potentially improve pain and other side effects relating to our condition (for example bowed legs), but at the time of writing this isn\u2019t a proven benefit of taking it.\nIn the run up to the documentary airing, I felt nauseous.\nI was angry, in a way, that this is a conversation deemed worthy of mainstream TV: How could it possibly be a debate that our existence as dwarves needs a potential cure, or that our disability needs to be thought of as an outcome to be \u2018improved\u2019 or somehow made less striking to appease the non-disabled gaze.\nWhy, in 2022, isn\u2019t our position in society further on than this \u2013 why are we still seen as a problem?\nDrugs like Vosoritide rely on non-disabled parents fearing the outcome of their disabled child\u2019s life and believing that by giving them the medication, they\u2019re helping them to get the best start.\nWatching the show, it was starkly obvious and quite bleak to see how the inner ableism of some of the non-disabled parents filmed really influenced their children into believing this was the best thing for them to do.\nAs the show unfolds, Ellie reveals that her initial reaction to the news about Vosoritide was one of dismissal. She discusses how having a family that strongly celebrated her identity as a disabled woman was key to helping her to understand that she doesn\u2019t need to be cured.\nMy youngest has just turned four, so is of prime age to take the drug. She won\u2019t be, though (Picture: Sam Davies)In a way, though, I do understand why many kids with dwarfism would be interested \u2013 growing up in rural Norfolk, my childhood years were undeniably tough.\nI was teased, bullied, ostracised, laughed at on the street, poked and pushed around at school. I didn\u2019t really have proper friends and I felt stiflingly lonely throughout my childhood.\nI was frustrated that I couldn\u2019t participate in sports events and that I wasn\u2019t allowed to enter dancing competitions because teachers saw me as the \u2018weak link\u2019.\nAnd I had it relatively easy \u2013 many kids with dwarfism experience much more severe abuse.\nThings have improved for kids with dwarfism since then, but not as much as we might hope.\nLuckily, like Ellie, I had parents that taught me society was the issue, not my disabled body.\nSo as I matured, rather than looking inwards to fix the problem, I looked outwards \u2013 and I became passionate about trying to help improve societal views of my disability to make life a bit easier for future generations of people like me.\nLike my two daughters \u2013 who both have achondroplasia. My youngest has just turned four, so is of prime age to take the drug. She won\u2019t be, though.\nAged four, all she cares about is whether she can watch Sing 2 on Saturday and how many Jammie Dodgers I\u2019ll let her have before 7am.\nShe is in no way equipped to make a decision to take a daily injection (though I can tell you now it\u2019s hard enough getting that kid to brush her teeth every day!) and I don\u2019t want to make it for her.\nWhen my kids are older, I don\u2019t want to have to explain to them that the reason they took a drug every single day for years was to grow a little taller. What does that say about how I feel about my own height?\nIt\u2019s not like we ignore disability in our house \u2013 quite the opposite \u2013 we talk about it often, and we celebrate it. It is my role to equip and empower my kids to own their disabled identity, to accept and, if they can, love themselves.\nMore: DisabilityAsking for help isn't easy - but it's even harder if you're disabled\nScrapping free lateral flows could be fatal for people like my brother Dan\nMy passport application was rejected because of my wheelchairOf course, the three of us all have days when we feel frustrated with our disability, that\u2019s natural.\nBut understanding that ableism, inaccessibility and other external factors are the real problems have helped us as a family accept and embrace the wonderful bodies we have.\nI believe a wide rollout of Vosoritide shifts the blame firmly back onto our disabled selves, but our bodies shouldn\u2019t be seen as something to cosmetically alter or improve.\nWe\u2019re incredible as we are and we don\u2019t need society or medicine to fix us.\nIf governments would fund better accessibility and social care for disabled people, and if the media would highlight these issues, then maybe people would see that the way we look has never been the problem.\nDo you have a story you\u2019d like to share?

Ice baths have even been said to improve reaction time and explosiveness in future workouts.\u2019\nMay help mental health\n\u2018Some research also shows that ice baths can have mental health benefits as they can help you relax and focus on breathing,\u2019 adds Penny.\n\u2018Most people don\u2019t find them a very pleasant experience at first though.\u2019\nFinnish ice bath expert Kyle Miller, explains that ice baths present both a physical and mental challenge \u2013 as you battle against your natural instincts to immerse yourself in the cold temperatures.\nHe says: \u2018The immediate shock to the system brings you almost into a state of meditation \u2013 allowing you to release any stress and to be completely present at the moment.\u00a0\n\u2018Immersing yourself in piercing temperatures is not an exercise that feels natural \u2013 but pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone to overcome the fear, makes you both physically and mentally stronger.\u2019\nShort-term relief\nHowever, experts point out that ice baths are only really good as a short-term fix \u2013 and should be used alongside other options.\u00a0\nDavid adds: \u2018There is research to suggest that ice baths speed up muscle recovery, but that they\u2019re only beneficial as a quick fix. For example, footballers who need a quick recovery between matches or runners who need a quick recovery between races. \n\u2018Unless you participate in intense sports and exercise, then they are not necessary as part of your recovery and shouldn\u2019t replace massages, stretching and yoga \u2013 which are just as beneficial.\u00a0\n\u2018Ultimately, the best natural recovery you can get is eating well and resting.\u2019\nMore: LifestyleWhy is delayed gratification so hot?\nHow to ask your landlord to let you do DIY in a rented home\nFirefighters cut woman's stuck wedding ring off as her finger began to turn blueKnow the risks\nIf you\u2019re considering it, there are some important things to note too.\nDavid says: \u2018There does come a risk with ice baths \u2013 immersing yourself into water which is too cold can send your body into shock and trigger hypothermia, which is why I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing it at home.\n\u2018Ice baths can also decrease the core body temperature by constricting blood vessels and slowing the blood flow of the body.

And experts don\u2019t necessarily advise it. \nInstead it might be better to find a place offering cryotherapy sessions.\nDavid says: \u2018If you were to do it at home, use a thermometer so you reduce the risk of the water being too cold. \n\u2018It needs to be between approximately 10 and 15 Celsius, and if you find the water too hot or too cold, keep adding either warmer or colder water until you hit the right temperature.\u2019\nDo you have a story to share?\nGet in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.\n\tMORE : Woman allergic to cold reveals how rare condition has \u2018turned life upside down\u2019\n\tMORE : Cold water swimming saves woman from constant pain and inspires her to write a novel\n\tMORE : Women are colder than men while working \u2013 and younger people feel the chill too "}, {"images": [{"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SEI_97103314.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C338", "alt": "Do ice baths actually work?

The right song coming on can help you keep going when you want to give up, and help you find new levels of intensity.\nBut the effects of the right gym music might not just be psychological. New research has found that listening to music can boost weightlifting performance by as much as 13%.\nIn fact, the study, conducted by Pure Gym, found that your weightlifting performance can be boosted by up to 37% depending on the type of music you choose to listen to.\nIn tracking the performance of gym goers completing the three main lifts \u2013 bench press, deadlift, and squat \u2013 in silence, as well as while listening to popular artists from a variety of genres, the researchers found that listening to pop music made the biggest difference in performance, followed closely by rap.\nWhich artists should you add to your playlist?\nUsing the artists and songs that appear most frequently on workout playlists on Spotify, the researchers then asked participants to perform their lifts across separate workouts while listening to the likes of Dua Lipa, Eminem and Metallica.\u00a0\nParticipants who worked out to Dua Lipa recorded on average a huge 37.93% increase in the amount of weight lifted versus when they lifted to no music.\u00a0\nThose who listened to Harry Styles were able to lift 35.71% on average, while BTS songs boosted strength by 22.47%.\nRap music did, of course, make the top five, with Eminem tunes improving strength by 12.68%, while at least one heavy metal artist, Metallica, made the top 10 with an increase of 8.33% on average.\n\t\t\t\tThe top 10

set), the top five was only a little different, with pop and rap music  still the only genres listed.\u00a0\nHarry Styles was number one this time, increasing reps by 23.03% per set.\u00a0\nDua Lipa was a close second, helping to increase reps by 22.03% on average.\u00a0\nNumber three was a wildcard, with Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s angsty songs increasing reps per set by an average of 6.07%.\u00a0\nIn fourth and fifth place respectively were The Weeknd, with a 3.88% increase, and Drake, with a 3.38% increase.\n\t\t\t\tThe top 5 artists to listen to if you want to increase your reps\t\t\tHarry

eight or nine hours of work in a day, you might have every intention in the world to go to the gym, clean the bathroom, cook dinner, prepare tomorrow\u2019s lunch and ring your mum.\nUsually though, it doesn\u2019t quite play out like that.\u00a0\nNot only will you find yourself with barely a sliver of time left for yourself before you need to hit the hay, it\u2019s quite likely that, by the time the clock strikes 5pm, you\u2019ll only have enough energy to do one or two of those things.\u00a0\nWhile it\u2019s true that work is draining, when you work a sedentary job, it can be surprising that the thought of moving even an inch after work can feel as intimidating as scaling Ben Nevis, or going 10 rounds with a pro boxer.\nAccording to Tom Bennet, development chef and nutrition expert at Muscle Food, what you eat for breakfast can have a lot to answer for your dwindling afternoon energy levels.\nMaking the right food choices early in the morning can make a big difference \u2013 and help you hit all your goals throughout the day.\nHow your breakfast impacts energy levels\nWhen you eat a breakfast that mainly consists of carbohydrates, such as toast or cereal, you\u2019ll likely find that you\u2019re already feeling hungry way before lunchtime.\u00a0\nYou also might start to feel tired sooner: this is because carbohydrates cause a spike in glucose and blood sugar levels, as well as insulin.\u00a0\nWhile this is great for facilitating a short burst of energy, such as before the gym, it\u2019s less helpful if you want your energy levels to last.\nBennet suggests adding a source of protein to your breakfast if you want to feel more energised in the afternoon.\n\t\t\t\tThe best foods for a protein-packed breakfast\t\t\tTry adding these protein sources to your breakfast to see your energy levels last:Egg whites\nChicken\u00a0\nTurkey\nSalmon\nQuinoa\nTofu\nGreek Yoghurt\nCottage cheese\nNut butter\nChickpeas\u2018Because protein is the macronutrient that takes the longest to digest, a high protein breakfast will leave you feeling fuller for longer,\u2019 says Bennet.\n\u2018Additionally, protein slows down the digestion of carbohydrates so balancing out your high carb meals with protein will reduce that insulin spike, putting you in a much better position to mitigate that hunger that sometimes hits between breakfast and lunch.\u2019\n\t\t\t\tEnergy-boosting breakfast ideas\t\t\tIf you\u2019re stuck on what to choose for your morning meal, there are a few options, whether you\u2019re a meat-eater, a pescetarian, veggie or vegan.\nMeaty breakfast ideas:Chicken or Turkey sausages with cheese omelettePescatarian breakfast ideas:Scrambled Eggs with SalmonVeggie breakfast ideas:Black bean omelette\nOvernight oats made using greek yoghurt, chia seeds, and almond butter\nProtein pancakes with greek yoghurt and berries or peanut butterVegan breakfast ideasScrambled tofu on toast with roasted chickpeasMore:

before' - over a third are on the brink of burnoutEssentially, a balanced breakfast, that has a mix of carbs, protein and fat, is the ideal breakfast to increase energy levels.\u00a0\nPlus, if you\u2019re a gym bunny, Bennet adds: \u2018Getting a good serving of protein with breakfast also means you\u2019ll be on a great track to get an adequate amount of protein throughout the day, so sets you off to a good start all round.\u2019\nDo you have a story to share?\nGet in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.\n\tMORE : People are making custard toast on TikTok \u2013 and

more prone to injury (Picture: Getty/iStockphoto)Have you been feeling off your fitness game recently? \nMaybe your workouts just aren\u2019t hitting like they usually do, maybe you\u2019ve stagnated on your progress, or your struggling with injury and lots of aches and pains.\nWell, stress might be the underlying cause.\nWe know that stress and burnout can leave us feeling mentally frazzled, but it can also impact your workouts and affect your physical health. So, if you find that you\u2019re feeling agitated, unmotivated or uninterested in working out, this could be down to underlying stress and could make you more susceptible to falling ill.\nLondon surgeon Carlos Cobiella \u2013 who has treated Hollywood\u2019s A-list actors, plus sportsmen and athletes \u2013 says there are warning signs that might be trying to tell you that stress is sabotaging your workout:\nYou\u2019re struggling to sleep\n\u2018If you feel exhausted but are struggling to sleep, this could be down to your body producing the stress hormone, Cortisol, which can often leave us feeling wide awake and struggling to sleep,\u2019 says Carlos. \n\u2018Cortisol is often released into the body when we do high impact exercise such as running and HIIT, but it can also be released when we feel stressed, wired and agitated.\u2019 \nCarlos says this then affects our sleep. \n\u2018And with higher levels of cortisol being released, the body remains in a state of hyperarousal and affects the quality of sleep,\u2019 he adds.\nYou feel more sore than usual\nWe know that it\u2019s normal to feel a little sore or tender after a good workout, especially if you are doing weights or long distance running, but Carlos says that if you\u2019re burning the candles at both ends, this can leave you feeling more tired after a workout and it could take your muscles longer to recover. \n\u2018If you feel your muscles are taking much longer to recover than usual, increase your rest days so you are not over doing it and running your body into the ground,\u2019 he suggests. \n\u2018Bad performance during a workout is also a sign that stress is affecting you. \n\u2018If you are struggling to be mentally in the zone during a workout and it\u2019s affecting your overall session, reduce your workouts and take more time to rest until you feel yourself again.\u2019\n\u2018Prolonged stress can impact our immune system, cause inflammation and essentially damage our muscles and joints\u2019 (Picture: Getty)You\u2019re gaining weight\n\u2018If you find you are gaining a little weight but you aren\u2019t doing anything differently with your diet and workout regime, this could be down to your hormones, especially if the weight gain is around your tummy,\u2019 says Carlos.\u00a0\nWhen you are feeling stressed or under pressure, Carlos says cortisol, the stress hormone, is released in higher amounts. \n\u2018This then means that your insulin production goes into overdrive which then triggers our sugar cravings meaning that you may find you are craving sweet things more often and when you\u2019re stressed it can often be hard to resist,\u2019 he says.\n\u2018Excessive cortisol in the body can also affect muscle mass meaning that your metabolism is thrown off and could slow down.\u2019\nYou feel under the weather\n\u2018Excessive cortisol production for longer periods of time can actually have a negative impact on your overall well being and immunity,\u2019 says Carlos.\n\u2018While we need cortisol to give us energy and fight off any illnesses, too much of it can also cause us to be more at risk of becoming ill. This is because Cortisol can attack our white blood cells meaning that we are more susceptible to becoming ill due to\u00a0 a weakened immune system.\u2019 \nCarlos adds that recovery is crucial if you start to feel unwell, so taking a good amount of rest days is advised. \n\u2018I would also suggest getting lots of fresh fruits and veggies into your diet to help boost your immune system, you should also ensure you are drinking plenty of water throughout the day to keep hydration levels up,\u2019 he says.\nMore: HealthThese are the six core personality traits that highly sensitive people possess\nMan in agony after misdiagnosed eczema says water feels like acid on his skin\nBrits are 'more exhausted than ever before' -

The automated therapy was found to work well for patients diagnosed with psychosis.\n\u2018After seven years of illness, I do feel so much better.

And, eventually, mammals were able to evolve and colonise the Earth.\nThe impact site of the asteroid was 3,000km from where the fossil was found (Credits: Metro UK/Google)Prof Paul Barrett, a dinosaur expert from London\u2019s Natural History Museum, looked at the leg from Tanis.\n\u2018It\u2019s a\u00a0Thescelosaurus. It\u2019s from a group that we didn\u2019t have any previous record of what its skin looked like, and it shows very conclusively that these animals were very scaly like lizards,\u2019 he told the BBC. \n\u2018They weren\u2019t feathered like their meat-eating contemporaries.\n\u2018This looks like an animal whose leg has simply been ripped off really quickly. There\u2019s no evidence on the leg of disease, there are no obvious pathologies, there\u2019s no trace of the leg being scavenged, such as bite marks or bits of it that are missing.\u2019\nAny dinosaurs that weren\u2019t killed by the asteroid blast would have suffered from the consequences of the impact.\nScientists believe the space rock would have triggered a series of powerful earthquakes and forest fires, as well as a number of continental landslides.\nThe impact would have triggered tsunamis, earthquakes and forest fires (Credits: BBC Studios)According to Dr Joanna Morgan, a seismologist who led experiments at the Chicxulub impact crater in Mexico, the debris from the explosion would have caused mass deaths.\nShe said it was \u2018ejected at high velocity into the atmosphere\u2019 and, as a result, the planet was plunged into darkness, causing a global winter that killed off many of the living species on Earth.\nThis has led the Tanis site to become a jumble of ancient relics.\nThe remains of animals and plants have been rolled together into a sediment dump by waves of river water upset by the earthquakes.\nExperts will likely be combing the site for a long time to come, so we may see even more amazing dinosaur discoveries from there in future.\n\tMORE : Sir David Attenborough to explore the lives of dinosaurs in epic new series Prehistoric Planet\n\tMORE : Mammals put brawns over brains to survive after meteor wiped out the dinosaurs\n \n  Sign Up for News UpdatesGet your need-to-know\nlatest news, feel-good stories, analysis and moreSign upNot convinced?

Further research would be needed to assess the impacts of other drying methods.\u2019\nWhat can we do about it?\nThe best thing is to avoid the tumble dryer altogether (Credits: Getty Images/EyeEm)Thankfully, there are ways we can change this. \nThe easiest and most straightforward is just not to use a tumble dryer \u2013 but to hang your clothes out and let them air dry. Your electricity bill will probably thank you for this as well.\nAlternatively, the researchers found that the use of fabric conditioners and dryer sheets, especially in combination, could significantly reduce microfibre release from tumble dryers.\nThey also found that lint filters with smaller pores would trap larger masses, resulting in far fewer microfibres being released into the air.\nThe lint filters were better at capturing polyester fibres than cotton fibres. This means that most microfibers released into the air by dryers are likely to be cotton.

The whole thing seems very substantial and a lot more \u2018classy\u2019 than the previous games, so it\u2019s nice to see the developer has been given the time to add some polish this time round.\nIt does however bring the question of what will be next, especially if Traveller\u2019s Tales is only going to end up making one more. I think the obvious answer is an Avengers: Infinity Ward game but I don\u2019t know how easy that is to licence nowadays compared to the last time they did one. It could be a DC game as well but all that usually means is Batman and friends and I\u2019m all Batman-ed out.\nI guess Harry Potter is the other obvious guess but thankfully that\u2019s something the kids have never got into, so it holds no interest to me. I\u2019m not sure what else thy could do if it\u2019s dependent on Lego already having the licence. A Super Mario game might seem obvious but how exactly would that work? I don\u2019t see a reskinned Super Mario Maker being quite as popular.Dolan\nThe real DaredevilI see a lot of talk regarding people being pretty miffed at these Elden Ring speedruns. However, I find them totally credible. What I find incredible is the guy that completed Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice blindfolded!\nDo GameCentral know if this is legit? Sadly I had to abandon the game at that 7 spears mini-boss, just haven\u2019t got the reaction times for this game. I can\u2019t comprehend how somebody could do this blindfolded.Amazing if it\u2019s true. Like that film about the blind swordsman, Zatoichi.Vaughan (Tiddleydwarf \u2013 PSN ID)\nGC: You can watch it right here; a bunch of people have done it. We don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s miffed about any of it though, just bemused at how it\u2019s even possible. He beats the final boss without taking any damage.\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@metro.co.uk\nThree demandsI\u2019ll be very interested to see what they do with the new Tomb Raider as I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ve got the grimdark serious Lara out of their system now and we can go back to the fun, snarky one from the original games. The biggest problem with the reboot trilogy is that Lara was too serious and there was too much focus on action. I\u2019m not say there should be no but the first one in particular was basically just a third person shooter and Lara just constantly murdering people even in the third one made no sense.\nActually, there\u2019s another thing they need to do and that\u2019s get an actual good story. I can\u2019t think of a single Tomb Raider that isn\u2019t goofy nonsense that makes Indiana Jones look like a documentary. It didn\u2019t matter with the old game but now that things look so realistic it would be nice if we had a plot that didn\u2019t seem like it was ripped off a Saturday morning cartoon.\nAnd please, whatever happens, no more Norse mythology. Try something original, try something that makes sense, and try something that\u2019s fun. I know it\u2019s not as easy as I\u2019m making it but Tomb Raider used to be the best game around and I\u2019d like to see it return to that.Chooper\nChanging timesSad to hear that Simply Games may have bit the dust. I\u2019ve used them many times in the past but I think it says a lot when I didn\u2019t even realise that their website had been down for a month. I guess I\u2019ll probably never get to use them again now, as like most people I now buy almost everything digitally.\nNot usually on day one but wait just a little bit and you can get some great deals that are well worth waiting for, and then you get all the benefits of games at your fingertips and no having to mess around with discs.\nI\u2019m already feeling nostalgic about getting a new game from Simply Games days before any of my friends, just because they always ignored release dates. Especially as that\u2019s one thing that digital games are definitely not going to do. It\u2019s a shame but times change and nothing lasts forever.Focus\nExtended helpRegarding Not the Cable Guy\u2019s question on PlayStation VR and 120Hz, I\u2019d be tempted to try plugging in a HDMI splitter, such as this one, which claims to support 120Hz @4K. One cable from the PlayStation 5 into the splitter, one cable out of the splitter straight to telly for 120Hz; the other cable out of the splitter into the PlayStation VR, then from the PlayStation VR to a second HDMI on the telly for VR use.\nOnly issue I might imagine is the PlayStation VR not being happy with an extra device between itself and the console, and of course needing a second free port on the telly. Hope this helps.Joe\nJust a suggestion for Not the Cable Guy\u2019s dilemma. You can buy HDMI extensions leads. I use one to switch between consoles. This means you do need to switch them over but not behind the TV. The extension lead will probably be in a much more convenient location. I use one that\u2019s hidden just out of view behind a cabinet. And additionally, the HDMI socket on your TV will not get worn. Hope this helps.Manic miner 100 (gamertag)\nWalk off with itThe free games on Epic Games Store on Thursday, from 4pm, are Rogue Legacy and The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter.

They\u2019ve got all the same toxic workplace problems as Activision but on top of that none of their games are even any good, just the same cookie cutter blandness again and again. They seem to have got especially bad in the last year or so with this push for live service games, with decision after decision that just seems to do nothing but upset fans.\nThey\u2019re attitude towards NFTs is terrible too. I mean, when you\u2019re making EA look reasonable you know you\u2019re doing something wrong but even after being told by everything that NFTs were a bad idea and they didn\u2019t want them Ubisoft has just turned around and basically said: \u2018Tough, you\u2019re getting them anyway.\u2019\nI don\u2019t usually pay that much attention to who a game\u2019s publisher is but I can\u2019t remember the last Ubisoft game that I even wanted to play, let alone enjoyed. I just don\u2019t see any love or passion in the games they make, they\u2019re just vehicles for microtransactions and NFTs and other money-making scams. Perhaps Ubisoft are just worst at hiding it, and all the big publishers are basically the same, but it doesn\u2019t seem that way at the moment.Starker\nInbox also-ransLoved the modern Tomb Raider trilogy but sincerely hope Crystal Dynamics are now doing a remake of the original 32-bit one.

It\u2019s been over 20 years since the Dreamcast and it\u2019s quite clear that Sega has no intention of resurrecting any of its older franchises in any meaningful way. It is willing to licence them out to other people though, as seen most successfully with Wonder Boy: The Dragon\u2019s Trap and Streets Of Rage 4, but that seems to be the best that can be hoped for.\nThe latter two games were both by French company Dotemu but Sega has worked with others too, such as Polish firm MegaPixel Studio, who did a passable job with the 2020 remake of Panzer Dragoon. And now they\u2019re back with a similarly styled remake of lightgun game The House Of The Dead. Which seems a very odd choice of game given the Switch version doesn\u2019t come with an actual lightgun, thereby removing at least 50% of the appeal before you\u2019ve even started.\nWe\u2019re really not sure what anyone involved expected to gain from such a venture, as while the original game is entertaining enough to make you pine for the days when Sega still made arcade machines, technical issues and the intractable problem of the controls are never properly addressed.\nFor those that don\u2019t recognise the name, The House Of The Dead was a 1996 Sega coin-op released just six months after the original Resident Evil. Despite the similarities between the two games, that is, by all accounts, a complete coincidence. A welcome one as it turned out though, as no less than George Romero credits the release of the two games with reigniting public interest in zombie media in general.\nLightgun games are, by their nature, simple beasts but The House Of The Dead does go to some small effort to try and tell a story, as you try to rescue as many scientists as possible (the game\u2019s similarity to Resident Evil in terms of plot, mansion setting, and hilariously bad dialogue is uncanny). Whether you do or not can determine whether you take an alternate route through the game, which ensures the experience is at least a little more than just a linear shooting gallery.\nMost of the time it is though and while there are secrets to be had by shooting background objects, including additional alternate routes, the gameplay basically comes down to being a good shot and memorising where enemies will pop up from next.\nThe very obvious problem here is that without an actual lightgun you\u2019re just controlling an onscreen cursor and while there\u2019s a myriad of control options for you to choose between nothing works quite as well as you\u2019d like, and the more you try the more it seems as if the whole remake was just a bad idea from the start.\nThe most obvious option is to try and use the gyro-aiming from a single Joy-Con, although peculiarly this is only possible if you\u2019re playing co-op. When playing solo we opted for a Pro Controller with gyro-aiming on top, but while this works well in theory the cursor almost immediately starts to drift no matter what you do \u2013 forcing you to either constantly reset it or rotate the controller round at increasingly odd angles as you play.\nSince this set-up works perfectly in Splatoon and other Switch shooters the fault is clearly with the developers, but unfortunately the controls aren\u2019t the only technical problem. There\u2019s a persistent glitch that sees the game completely freeze up for a second or more, for no obvious reason. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a frame rate issue per se and while there is a performance mode, which is unusual in a Switch game, it doesn\u2019t seem to help.\nThe House Of The Dead: Remake \u2013 the dialogue is wonderfully bad (pic: Forever Entertainment)This is clearly an even lower budget production than Panzer Dragoon, with extremely basic graphics that will you have forgetting this is a remake at all. That\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t look better than the original arcade game, because it does, but the improvement is so unremarkable all it does is keep pace with your memories, as you only occasionally find yourself thinking \u2018this looks better than I remember\u2019.\nAlthough this is billed as a remake the main game is more or less exactly as it was in the arcades, just with slightly better graphics. That means it lasts barely 30 minutes on one playthrough and while it is highly replayable there are clearly limits on how many times you\u2019ll want to go through it looking for new secrets or a higher score.\nMore: Games newsFans think there\u2019s a secret GTA 6 teaser in the Definitive Edition of San Andreas\n\u2018Will Smith\u2019 is invading Elden Ring games to slap people and then leave\nChrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition review \u2013 the future agreed to changeThe game is at its best with another player, which the Switch makes easy, and there is a new mode to play through with them, called Horde. However, all this does is add over 10 times more zombies on-screen. That is a lot of zombies, and there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s a lot of fun the first time, but whatever nuance the original mode had is completely lost when you\u2019re just hosing down the undead without the chance for a single tactic to form in your head.\nThe same team is apparently also working on The House Of The Dead 2 but even if they address the technical problems of this first game it\u2019s hard to understand what the point is supposed to be. Not when there are so many other Sega classics, of the same era and beyond, that don\u2019t have a control system that\u2019s impossible to recreate without additional hardware.\nEven if this was a technically more accomplished remake it\u2019d still be a fundamentally flawed idea. Given how badly put together it is, it\u2019s hard not to see The House Of The Dead as one Sega franchise that should probably have stayed (un)dead.\n\t\t\t\tThe House Of The Dead: Remake review summary\t\t\tIn Short: A bad idea poorly realised and while the original coin-op retains its campy charm this remake is rendered pointless by the unsatisfying controls and glitchy performance.\nPros: The original game is still a well-orchestrated lightgun game and the terrible dialogue always gets a laugh. Horde mode is a welcome, if minor, addition and co-op is fun despite the technical problems.\nCons: Serious performance issues and a myriad of control options\u2026 none of which are close to satisfying. Weak graphics and a lack of game modes and new content.\nScore: 4/10\nFormats: Nintendo SwitchPrice: \u00a322.49Publisher: Forever EntertainmentDeveloper: MegaPixel Studio and Sega AM1Release Date: 7th April 2022Age Rating: 18\nEmail\u00a0gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and\u00a0follow us on Twitter.\n\tMORE : Sega quits running arcades after 50+ years \u2013 could still make coin-ops\n\tMORE : Second Sega arcade mini-console out next year \u2013 shmup fans will love it\n\tMORE : Sega back-pedals on NFTs but GameStop announces dedicated marketplace\nFollow Metro Gaming on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and email us at\u00a0gamecentral@metro.co.uk\nFor more stories like this,\u00a0check our Gaming page. \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NSwitchDS_TheHouseOfTheDeadRemake_05-9813.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C362", "alt": "The House Of The Dead: Remake screenshot"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NSwitchDS_TheHouseOfTheDeadRemake_04-137a.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=540%2C303", "alt": "The House Of The Dead: Remake screenshot"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FProznlXsAYEFkD-3060.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=121px%2C0px%2C728px%2C546px&resize=480%2C360&zoom=1", "alt": "zone post image for post 16423720"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_2-cf07.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=45px%2C0px%2C485px%2C364px&resize=480%2C360&zoom=1", "alt": "zone post image for post 16410868"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/03_chrono_cross_RD_keyvisual-cc8b.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C574px%2C1420px%2C1065px&resize=480%2C360&zoom=1", "alt": "zone post image for post 16415426"}, {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/game-central-promo-661e.png?strip=true&quality=90", "alt": "Gaming"}]}]}, {"url": "https://metro.co.uk/2022/04/07/emmerdale-spoilers-april-takes-beautiful-action-for-struggling-rhona-16374270/", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Emmerdale spoilers: April takes beautiful action for struggling Rhona"}, {"author_container": "Sue Haasler"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 22:00:00"}, {"article_body": "\nRhona is bottling her emotions (Picture: ITV)Ever since Marlon (Mark Charnock) had his stroke on Emmerdale, Rhona (Zoe Henry) has been struggling to cope with the catastrophic change in their lives.\nIn upcoming episodes, Marlon\u2019s daughter April (Amelia Flanagan) can see that Rhona is buckling under the pressure, and decides to something nice for her.\nIt\u2019s Rhona\u2019s birthday, so April organises a surprise birthday party for her at the Woolpack, giving friends and family the chance to rally round and show Rhona some love and support. \nMore: Soaps26 new Emmerdale pics reveal Meena's verdict and shocking courtroom accusation\nKirk is promoted after achievement which stuns Carla in Corrie\nEmmerdale star reveals all on Meena's inappropriate relationship with prison officerIt\u2019s a beautiful, thoughtful gesture and it leaves Rhona feeling very moved by April\u2019s kindness.\nChas (Lucy Pargeter) offers to visit Marlon in Rhona\u2019s place so she can spend more time at the party for April\u2019s sake, but it\u2019s not long before she\u2019s itching to visit the hospital and see how he\u2019s doing.\nApril begs to come too, but Marlon is still reluctant to let his daughter see him.

We doubt this made her any calmer, though!\nAs Jean busied herself baking after her recent sex blunder, she soon received a video call from Sean, who picked up on how quickly she was talking. \nBut Jean insisted she was simply happy and was still taking her medication; and suggested that her son and daughter should be content knowing their mother is in a good place.\nThe conversation then turned to Sean and Stacey\u2019s unconventional childhood, and Jean responded to Sean\u2019s reminder by referencing his role in his father Brian\u2019s death several years ago.\nSean concluded that his mum was \u2018fine\u2019 (Picture: BBC)Sean kept his cool as he told Jean he had been working hard in therapy to get past such demons after suffering with depression. The pair managed to avoid a row, and Jean ended the chat so she could return to her cooking.\nAt the Slaters\u2019, Stacey received a bunch of flowers from Sean (can we get a delivery as speedy as that, please?) with a note saying: \u2018Mum is fine.
