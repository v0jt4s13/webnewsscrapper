It now all hangs on next week\u2019s second leg in France.\n The Hammers had reached this point - their first European quarter-final in 41 years -thanks to a momentous evening at the London Stadium against Sevilla, overcoming a first leg deficit in superb style.\n This would be a different challenge. Not only was it a first leg but the Hammers were fancied as favourites given Lyon\u2019s indifferent form domestically.\n It is only two years since the French side were in the semi-finals of the Champions League, however, and they are well versed in what makes the difference at this level.\n It was ahead of Sevilla that Moyes had warned of being drawn in by the dark arts, but the same could have applied here.\n A first half dominated by the visitors, making the most of small challenges, came to be defined by just that as a fine effort from West Ham was completely undone on the brink of the interval with Cresswell given his marching orders.\n After Moussa Dembele broke through the West Ham rearguard, Cresswell came flying back and, just as the former Fulham man poked the ball away from goal, he laid a soft hand on his shoulder, allowing the Frenchman the chance to go tumbling down and give German referee, Felix Zwayer, the chance to show a direct red.\n Cresswell, who on Wednesday said this was the biggest game of his 14-year professional career, slapped his hands across his face as Dembele sent a Cristiano Ronaldo style wink in the direction of a teammate.\n Moyes takes pride in his side having a backbone these days and they were able to show it here. The Scot earned himself a booking for venting his frustrations at Zwayer at the break but his team responded in a much better manner.\n With Lyon pushing forward Michail Antonio broke away and dragged them forward. Lyon recovered but gave possession up cheaply to Pablo Fornals on the edge of the box. After exchanging passes with Antonio the Spaniard moved to slip the ball into Bowen.\n Jerome Boateng, a World Cup winning defender, made a hash of intercepting, allowing Bowen to turn back and fire goal-ward, his shot deflecting past Anthony Lopes and in.\n It was scrappy, but after a first half in which they felt a sting of injustice - no one cared.\n Moyes raced onto the pitch in celebration rather than remonstration, pumping both fists back towards the main stand. The home fans partied as they had here last month against Sevilla, chants of \u201cWest Ham are massive\u201d once again echoing around.\n This was not following quite the same fairytale script, though.\n Lyon were pinning West Ham back, looking to exploit their advantage, and quickly found the only defensive crack of the evening.\n Tete, the Brazilian signed from Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk last week, skipped past Ben Johnson - sent on after the red card - and crossed low. A slight touch from Alphonse Areola sent it into Ryan Fredericks, who blocked and could only watch as the impressive Tottenham loanee Ndomele poked home a leveller.\n From there, West Ham were resolute and determined to go to France with it all to play for. Areola saved from Lucas Paqueta and Emerson Palmeri while Kurt Zouma and Craig Dawson were robust in dealing with Dembele.\n Perhaps the biggest frustration for Moyes, Cresswell\u2019s sending off aside, would have been towards one of his own supporters.\n West Ham were not just resting on their laurels but looking to break and cause Lyon trouble too.\n They were doing just that, Fornals fizzing a ball to the feet of Declan Rice, as one idiotic supporter burst onto the pitch and into the Lyon box, stopping proceedings. Moyes and his players were dumbstruck.\n The hosts had to quickly refocus, Areola palming away more efforts during eight minutes of added time and Antonio back putting his body on the line to block the rebound.\n That was not the home advantage they were looking for, especially as they look ahead to a second leg in front of a hostile crowd.\n West Ham do, however, go there with everything in the balance.\n Moyes will have his complaints over the sending off but he can have few about the response to it - this was another test passed by his side.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/22/SEI97637605.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "West Ham player ratings vs Lyon: Standout display from Jarrod Bowen with Craig Dawson no-nonsense"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/21/newFile-4.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "West Ham 1-1 Lyon: Ten-man Hammers stay in Europa League tie despite Tanguy Ndombele equaliser"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/20/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Declan Rice: Jack Wilshere sends Arsenal message in huge praise of West Ham star "}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/22/newFile-1.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=3657%3A2439%2Csmart", "alt": ""}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/sport/golf/tiger-woods-masters-2022-fairy-tale-false-dawn-b992891.html?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=homepage_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=2", "page_details": [{"post_title": "1/48In Pictures | Tiger Woods "}, {"author_container": "By    Matt Majendie @mattmajendie 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 09:13:02"}, {"article_body": "Fore please, Tiger Woods, now driving.\n It is the traditional greeting at the commencement of any opening Masters round, be it a five-time champion like Woods or one of the 18 debutants this year at Augusta National (albeit with a name change).\n And it is the above six words that those gathering on the first tee will await with bated breath shortly before 10.34am local time today \u2013 a little after 3.30pm here in the UK.\n In fact, no more pronouncement will be more hotly anticipated than that of Woods, whose every move - from his initial flight to Augusta for a practice round with son Charlie last month to a final practice round on the back nine yesterday - has been closely monitored.\n What follows next, no one quite knows, not even Woods. He had talked about being here to win, to believe in a fairy tale to eclipse the events of 2019 even. But is that genuine belief or merely the sort of bravado that has helped him get through hours of agony in a hospital bed, even longer in rehabilitation?\n Usually so guarded, he was not afraid to admit on the event of this Masters that there had not been a day without pain since his car careered off the road at 85mph back in February 2020, and he lived to fight another day.\n All the indications were that his golfing career \u2013 at least competitively \u2013 was over, and when he contemplated it all, he was content if that was the case. The numbers stack up nicely: 15 Major wins, 82 PGA Tour titles, and talking on Tuesday he said he would walk away content even if they were never added to again.\n Even now on the 25th anniversary of his first Masters win, he remains golf\u2019s biggest draw. He pocketed \u00a36million for not even playing last season as part of the PGA Tour\u2019s Player Impact Programme, aimed at rewarding those that bring the most attention to the game. Whatever his results this season, one suspects another big cheque will be coming his way at the end.\n Woods has been in the heads, hearts and mouths of the Augusta patrons all week, so too the 90 other players that will tee off alongside him today.\n And it was as much the Tiger name prowling within touching distance of the front-runners on the leaderboard in 2019 which paved the way for a multitude of on-course capitulations. Some of the world\u2019s best players fell apart with the sort of shots that might not have happened had a player of lesser stature been breathing down their necks.\n Repeating the miracle of 2019 is surely unthinkable and, in truth, this is not about the Green Jacket, although it is salivating to think that he has been to the brink and back to win it just a few years ago.\n Were he to miss the cut \u2013 imminently possible in his first official ranking tournament since his last Masters appearance in 2020 \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be anti-climactic. Instead, if up to that point there are glimpses of the old Woods, it will offer a hope of just the beginning of his latest and unlikeliest comeback, with a summer return to St Andrew\u2019s looming, scene of his first Open Championship win in 2000 by eight strokes.\n He still has a mountain to climb in terms what he\u2019s been through but also in the demanding undulations of Augusta, which a seasoned professional like Justin Rose said left him huffing and puffing, and sore when at his fittest.\n It is a big question mark hovering over Woods, its hilly nature merely adding a further hurdle to the comeback trail.\n If it were merely down to the goodwill of his peers, he would already be donning a Green Jacket for a sixth time but the game has moved on in his absence and there are a myriad of players that could challenge for the title come Sunday.\n There are the past champions such as Dustin Johnson, whose final round at the Players suggested the 2020 Masters champion might be timing his return to form to aplomb.\n There are those attempting to make history like Rory McIlroy, aiming to emulate the five players to have won the clean sweep of Majors, Woods the last of them to do so.\n And there are the rising stars predicted to make their mark like Cameron Smith, Viktor Hovland and new world No1 Scottie Scheffler.\n None would deny that top billing belongs to Woods, the players talking as excitedly about having him back in the field as any golfing enthusiast.\n The last word, though, surely belongs to the man himself, who knows his body better than anyone else. Previously, it had been a back injury that had curtailed his golf, now it is pure mobility, having gone from three months in a hospital bed to a wheelchair then crutches, to walking and then finally picking up a golf club.\n \u201cI still have the hands to do it and I can still move,\u201d he said, producing the sort of shots in practice to back up the claim. \u201cI\u2019ve been in worse situations than I feel right now and won tournaments.\u201d\n Surely not this time. But with Tiger Woods, you never quite know. \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/10/newFile-2.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Tiger Woods won\u2019t play the Masters \u2018unless he thinks he can win\u2019, says Padraig Harrington"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/05/16/GettyImages-1389552643.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Tiger Woods insists he can win 2022 Masters as he confirms intention to play at Augusta"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/04/17/GettyImages-1333963922.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Laird Shepherd interview: Amateur on how Tesco call centre stint helped drive Masters dream "}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/08/newFile-4.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "When does the Masters start?

The forward is playing with a freedom he has rarely enjoyed since arriving in 2015 from Nottingham Forest. Gone is the pressure of a relegation battle but, most importantly, he no longer fears feeling a tweak in his hamstring.\n Tonight\u2019s historic Europa League quarter-final against Lyon is a huge moment for West Ham, but for their No9 it is also a significant milestone.\n When the 32-year-old walks out at the London Stadium, it will be his 38th appearance of the season, matching his highest-ever tally in one season for West Ham, with almost two months of the campaign still to run.\n Hamstring injuries and muscle problems have dogged his time at the club, but now Antonio finally has confidence in his body to compete at the highest level, despite the gruelling schedule brought about by European and international commitments.\n \u201cIt has been amazing,\u201d Antonio tells Standard Sport. \u201cI\u2019ve loved every minute of it. Setbacks are hard to take, especially when you are trying your hardest and feel like you are doing all the right stuff. This season, throwing in even international games, with no real breaks, my body has managed to stay together.\u201d\n It is quite the difference from the days he would hold back from giving his all through fear of another injury.\n \u201cIt was difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really sprinting 100 per cent. There were certain things in the back of my mind, where I was thinking, \u2018My hamstring is going to go, it\u2019s going to go\u2019. Mentally, it was a battle. Now, being able to play freely, it is a huge weight lifted off of me.\u201d\n Many people, including manager David Moyes, held concerns over what this season could do to Antonio\u2019s body, given the relentless schedule European football brings. But a grounding in non-League with Tooting and Mitcham and years in the Football League with Reading, Southampton, Sheffield Wednesday and Forest meant he was ready for the challenge.\n \u201cHaving come through non-League, my body is used to playing this amount of games,\u201d says Antonio. \u201cI told the manager and physio that I am used to playing week in, week out. In the Championship it was Saturday, Tuesday, Saturday, Tuesday. My body did that for seven years before coming to the Premier League.\n \u201cGoing Thursday-Sunday now, I feel like I am used to it. You don\u2019t train as much, all you do is prepare for games. My body is always able to play in the games.\n \u201cI am going for it now. The beginning of the season I was holding back a bit, but as time has gone by I\u2019ve been getting stronger and stronger as the season has gone on. I managed to play 120 [minutes, against Sevilla], then played against Spurs on the Sunday \u2014 and there was no complication. These are the things that kept me going and made me believe that my body can be alright.\u201d\n Antonio had the support of friends, family and the medical staff at West Ham during those times, but he has worked hard to put them behind him. A tailored gym routine focused on his hamstrings has helped; so, too, after some experimentation, an overhauled diet.\n \u201cI\u2019ve tried to change it multiple times,\u201d he says. \u201cI gave up alcohol, tried to be vegan for a week \u2014 I couldn\u2019t do it \u2014but now I don\u2019t eat red meat. It\u2019s just chicken, fish and I have loads of vegetables. Veg is an alkaline and it helps to combat ninflammation in the muscles.\u201d\n Those changes are working, and Moyes talks of a more mature player to the one he has worked with in the past.\n The Scot now has so much faith in Antonio that he has been confident to turn down signings to support his only striker for more than a year, preferring to stick with him over a gamble in the market.\n But their relationship has not always been so straightforward. During Moyes\u2019s first spell at West Ham, he dropped Antonio from a squad after he was late to a team meeting \u2014 a clear line in the sand.\n \u201cWhen he came the first time, there was a bit of a fall-out between me and him,\u201d Antonio concedes. \u201cWe moved on from that quite quickly and finished the season quite well.\n \u201cOne thing with the gaffer is that even if you\u2019ve had a falling-out, he will easily forget. You can go in and have a full-on row with each other, but from that row we both respect each other as player and manager.\u201d\n That does not mean there is no longer the need for choice words to be exchanged every now and then.\n \u201cThere are definitely some voices being raised and digging people out,\u201d he says.\n \u201cScary? Yeah. It is needed. People need to be lifted and know if they\u2019re not doing well. That is one thing we get from him and from player to player. Everyone demands the best from each other; the coaching staff and players, we all demand it and we will keep pushing each other.\u201d\n That collective drive has taken West Ham to the dizzying heights they are now experiencing and enjoying.\n \u201cI have been here a long time and four out of the seven seasons I have been here we\u2019ve been in relegation battles,\u201d says Antonio. \u201cI love that we are looking up, instead of looking back.\n \u201cThe pressure of relegation is awful. It is a completely different pressure now. It is good pressure, because it shows that we are doing well.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/08/13/13/WestHamPredictedXIRicev1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "West Ham XI vs Lyon: Predicted lineup, confirmed team news and injury latest for Europa League today"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/03/15/SEI96916845.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "West Ham vs Lyon live stream: How can I watch Europa League game on TV in UK today?

But that is also the allure.\n Pochettino is proven in the Premier League, but also proven to have failed to win the title when in a two-horse race with Leicester.\n Proven to have been unable to arrest Tottenham\u2019s alarming slide that ultimately cost him his job. That is, of course, a very simplistic assessment of his time in England.\n He was also proven to have handled his transition to this country by turning Southampton into one of the most watchable teams in the top-flight.\n Proven to have nurtured individual talents at Spurs, regularly competing at the top of the table and reaching the Champions League Final in 2019 \u2013 famously at the expense of Ten Hag\u2019s Ajax. If he lasts the course at Paris Saint-Germain this season, he will be a title-winner.\n Yet Ten Hag has emerged from a series of talks as the man United want to lead them into a new era. And for all the due diligence of football director John Murtough and technical director Darren Fletcher, perhaps it is the mystery surrounding the Dutchman that gives him the edge.\n United cannot know if he will be able to adapt to the Premier League after a career spent in the Netherlands and Germany. They cannot know if he can handle a club of such stature that even managerial heavyweights like Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho were swallowed up by the expectation.\n They cannot know how he will cope with the egos in a dressing room full of fabulously wealthy young men, nor how those players will react to him.\n He is not the safe option, yet feels like the populist one, given the clamour on social media to declare him the next big thing. That is what new chief executive Richard Arnold is banking on.\n His predecessor Ed Woodward spent the majority of his reign regretting his failure to lure Klopp to United, with his \u2018adult Disneyland\u2019 pitch now becoming the stuff of legend.\n He watched the German do to Liverpool what a succession of managers failed to replicate at Old Trafford, waking them from their slumber and turning them into a super power.\n Even now, Klopp is the most perfect choice for United in terms of personality, leadership and his brand of football. More so even than Pep Guardiola.\n Klopp just gets it \u2013 and, the uncomfortable truth is that he probably got precisely what United were when rejecting Woodward\u2019s advances.\n Can Ten Hag be Klopp mark two? That is the bet being made by Arnold, Murtough and Fletcher. For a start, the football is right.\n It is about risk, relentless attacking and bravery on the ball. It is proactive in the form of a Klopp or a Guardiola, rather than reactive like a Mourinho.\n It is of the school of dominating possession \u2013 as would be expected of a Dutchman \u2013 but not the type of risk-averse fare that so turned United fans off during Van Gaal\u2019s reign.\n Ten Hag gives freedom to his most exciting talents to showcase their skills. Jadon Sancho should be a big beneficiary and Marcus Rashford may rediscover himself under a coach who will nurture his attacking qualities, which have been lost over the past 18 months.\n Hakim Ziyech and Donny van de Beek are two players who have failed to replicate the form they showed under Ten Hag since leaving Ajax. Van de Beek will welcome his arrival at Old Trafford after being bafflingly under-used since joining United.\n Ten Hag has taken the fans along with him on his Ajax journey and United are in need of a ringmaster at Old Trafford who they can truly get behind.\n Their fans are good at supporting their managers, even if they have been tested by the thin gruel offered up post-Sir Alex Ferguson.\n Van Gaal and Mourinho tried to re-educate them in what they should expect as supporters of the biggest club in the land.\n Neither could put up particularly convincing arguments \u2013 Mourinho snarling, and Van Gaal just never quite getting the sense of jeopardy that keeps them coming back to Old Trafford.\n Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did \u2013 and arguably provided supporters with more memorable moments than those two predecessors combined \u2013 but did not possess the coaching or managerial qualities to deliver trophies.\n Ten Hag is a proven winner in the Netherlands, but that record comes with a \u2018but\u2019 for that very reason. Ajax are the biggest and the richest, so success comes hand in hand. That is why that Champions League run is so instructive.\n The irony, of course, is that Pochettino\u2019s Tottenham reached the final at Ajax\u2019s expense. What is the greater achievement?\n Pochettino plays progressive, aggressive football. Ask Spurs fans if he has the charisma to make people follow him.\n It is hard to think of a box Ten Hag ticks that the Argentine does not. Well, that is, all except one \u2013 the element of the unknown.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/10/newFile-5.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Manchester United identify Harry Kane and Declan Rice as dream transfer targets with Erik ten Hag deal close"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/17/newFile-2.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Austrian FA deny Ralf Rangnick meeting as new role at Manchester United looms"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/20/1385120481.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Manchester United close in on Erik ten Hag deal after needing just one round of interviews in new manager hunt"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/15/newFile-1.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=1287%3A858%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Ajax boss Erik ten Hag is set to become the next permanent manager of Manchester United </p>"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/23/08/newFile.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=4488%3A2993%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Ten Hag has been preferred by the United hierarchy to long-term target Mauricio Pochettino </p>"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/17/newFile-1.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=2045%3A1364%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Ten Hag has drawn favourable comparisons to Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp </p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-injury-news-latest-confirmed-thomas-partey-premier-league-2022-b993140.html?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=homepage_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=5", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Arsenal injury news: Thomas Partey in race against time to play again this season"}, {"author_container": "By    Simon Collings @sr_collings 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 15:52:03"}, {"article_body": "Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey faces a race to be fit before the end of the season after injuring his thigh.\n Partey suffered the injury during Monday night\u2019s defeat to Crystal Palace when he was forced to limp off in the second-half.\n The Ghana international has since been assessed by Arsenal\u2019s medical team and a scan has shown damage to his right thigh.\n Partey will be monitored in the coming weeks and during that time he will also visit a specialist for further consultation.\n Given the season ends on May 22, the 28-year-old is short on time to recover but it is understood he has not given up hope of returning before the campaign finishes.\n Losing Partey is a major blow to Arsenal, who also this week confirmed left-back Kieran Tierney will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury.\n The Gunners are back in action on Saturday when they take on Brighton and will look to bounce back from Monday\u2019s loss to Palace.\n Arsenal currently sit fifth in the Premier League, but they are level on points with Tottenham in fourth and have a game in hand on them.\n An Arsenal statement on Partey read: \u201cOur No. 5 was substituted during Monday night\u2019s game against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park after aggravating his right thigh.\n \u201cThomas has since received further assessments, and a subsequent scan has shown muscle damage to his right thigh.\n \u201cWe will continue to assess Thomas in the coming weeks, during which time he will also receive further specialist consultations.\n \u201cEveryone will be working hard to get Thomas back on the pitch as soon as possible.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/15/newFile-5.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Francis Coquelin shares Arsenal insight on Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla - \u2018I could send them rubbish balls\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/15/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Cody Gakpo: PSV forward drops hint as transfer links continue - \u2018I like Arsenal a lot\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/11/newFile-3.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "How Arsenal could line up after huge Kieran Tierney injury blow...

You give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine,\" Mr Kuleba said.\n After six weeks of a war that Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Ukraine says Russia continues to shell eastern cities following its forces\u2019 withdrawal from around Kyiv.\n Britain\u2019s Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said there had been agreement at the Brussels summit to help the Ukrainian defenders upgrade their \"Soviet era equipment to Nato standard equipment on a bilateral basis\".\n She also labelled Mr Putin\u2019s Kremlin a \"global pariah\" after a United Nations vote to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council.\n The UN General Assembly voted by 93 to 24 to suspend Russia from the human rights body, with 58 abstentions.\n Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine issued three pleas to Nato members to defeat Mr Putin\u2019s invasion: \u201cWeapons, weapons, weapons\u201d.\n Ahead of the high-level talks at the summit, Mr Kuleba stressed more military equipment was vital to prevent \u201cenormous sacrifices\u201d and \u201cmore Buchas\u201d, the town near Kyiv where Russian forces are accused of killing more than 300 civilians in war crimes including executions, torture, mass graves and rapes.\n Britain, which has played a leading role in the West\u2019s response to Mr Putin\u2019s war which has left thousands, if not tens of thousands, of civilians dead, is now set to send protected mobility vehicles for Ukraine\u2019s military.\n A delegation led by Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Defence Minister Volodymyr Havrylov, including senior military officers, visited the Salisbury Plain training area earlier this week where they saw the armoured vehicles, as well as loitering munitions, which hang in the air and can then be later deployed against a target, and the high-speed Starstreak missile system which has already been sent to Ukraine.\n The British army\u2019s third Division and the Royal Marines demonstrated various weapons and talks are ongoing on which could be supplied and used by the Ukrainian military.\n The protected mobility vehicles may have some sensitive equipment stripped out of them before being sent to Ukraine.\n Boris Johnson also held talks with Poland\u2019s President Andrzej Duda in No10, with Britain offering more humanitarian support to Warsaw to help with the huge number of refugees coming over the border from Ukraine.\n Mr Kuleba urged more countries in the West to \u201cput aside their hesitations, their reluctance\u201d and to supply more arms, stressing that \u201cas weird as it may sound today weapons serve the purpose of peace\u201d.\n Arriving at the summit, he said: \u201cMy agenda is very simple, it has only three items on it... Weapons, weapons and weapons.\u201d\n He stressed Ukraine had shown the world that \u201cwe know how to fight\u201d and \u201chow to win\u201d against the Russian president\u2019s troops.\n His appeal came amid growing fears that Mr Putin is set to unleash within a week, or a few weeks, a \u201cnew bloody wave\u201d in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine after his original invasion plan, to seize Kyiv within days, failed.\n British military intelligence chiefs said Thursday morning that Russian artillery and air strikes were continuing along the \u201cline of control\u201d in the Donbas which includes the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, where Moscow-backed separatists hold some territory.\n Ukrainian government officials were urging civilians to evacuate the eastern regions threatened by the new Russian onslaught.\n Military experts say upcoming battles in the Donbas could be key to the outcome of the war, with suggestions the Russian president wants to declare some form of victory on May 9, to coincide with the annual parade in Moscow\u2019s Red Square held to mark the Nazis\u2019 surrender in the Second World War.\n Ms Truss stressed Britain was responding to Ukraine\u2019s call for more military hardware.\n She said: \u201cThe UK is now banning all imports of Russian energy, we are sanctioning more banks and we are stepping up our supply of weapons to Ukraine.\u201d\n Germany has also started supplying military equipment to Ukraine. But Mr Kuleba pleaded for some nations in the West, including Germany, to do more.\n \u201cWhile Berlin has time, Kyiv doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that her country is \u201clooking closely with our partners at how we can support Ukraine in the future more intensively, and more coordinated because they have a right of self defense and we will support this\u201d.\n Mr Kuleba stressed Ukraine\u2019s military needs planes, heavy air defence system, and missiles vehicles from Nato members.\n Nato is not itself providing any weapons, amid concerns that if it did this could allow Mr Putin to seek to escalate the conflict into one between Nato and Russia, so military equipment is being provided by individual nations in bilateral arrangements.\n But the Alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: \u201cUkraine is fighting a defensive war, so this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons doesn\u2019t actually have any real meaning.\u201d\n The Czech government is reported to be sending Soviet era tanks which Ukrainian forces are trained in using.\n The US has already provided more than $2.3 billion (\u00a31.7 billion) of lethal assistance to Ukraine since January 2021, including a a $100 million (\u00a376 million) transfer of Javelin anti-armour missiles announced days ago, and was also reported to be training Ukrainian forces in the use of military drones.\n Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelensky is also calling for tougher sanctions against Mr Putin\u2019s regime otherwise the Kremlin would see it as \u201cpermission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas\u201d.\n A fifth round of European Union sanctions on Russia, including a ban on coal imports, could be agreed by the bloc on Friday, the EU\u2019s top diplomat Josep Borrell said.\n Ms Truss announced on Wednesday that the UK was freezing the assets of Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest bank, and Credit Bank of Moscow, banning all new investment in Russia and targeting eight more oligarchs, with similar steps being taken in America.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

the Oscars last month after the comedian made a joke about his wife\u2019s hair loss condition. \n Rock has been widely criticised for the gag but Gervais has come out in his defence. \n Responding to fans on the subject during a Twitter Q&A, The Office star said: \u201cYou don\u2019t hit people over a joke, however bad it is. And it wasn\u2019t bad!\n \u201cThat was like the tamest joke I would ever have told.\n \u201cSomeone said it was joking about her disability.\n \u201cWell I\u2019m going a bit thin, so I\u2019m disabled. That means I can park right up next to Tescos now.\u201d\n He added: \"And I\u2019m fat. That\u2019s a disease, isn\u2019t it?\"\n Gervais then joked how he should be able to apply for benefits due to his \u201cdisability\u201d.\n \u201cI\u2019m fat and balding. I should get f***ing benefits,\u201d he quipped.\n It is not the first time Gervais has aired his opinions about the shocking incident.\n Last week, while performing in London,\u00a0Gervais\u00a0said on stage: \u201cI\u2019ll get it out of the way. I have not got any Will Smith material.\n \u201cI trended when that happened and I was not even there. \u2018What would have happened if Ricky\u00a0Gervais\u00a0had been doing it [hosting the Oscars]?\u2019\"\n \u201cWell, nothing,\u201d he continued.\n He then went on to explain that rather than focus on Pinkett Smith\u2019s hair, he would have made a jibe about her well-known affair with \u201cboyfriend\u201d August\u00a0Alsina.\n Singer Alsina is now reportedly planning to release a tell-all book about his relationship with Pinkett Smith.\n Gervais has not hosted the Oscars but has hosted the Golden Globes five times.\n His jokes about Hollywood stars are famously close to the bone. His awards show repertoire has included gags about Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u201csuicide\u201d and the age of Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s date.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

{"post_date": "2022-04-07 10:19:14"}, {"article_body": "Tourists will have to wear face masks indoors in Spain during the Easter break. \n It had been thought face coverings could be ditched at all times in the UK\u2019s favourite sunshine destination in time for the first busy holiday period of the year.\n But Spanish Health Minister Carolina Darias told regional officials on Wednesday the government was not planning on approving the lifting of their mandatory status in public spaces indoors like restaurants and hotels until April 19.\n Their mandatory use indoors is expect to end between April 21 or 22 when the new ruling is published in an Official State Bulletin.\n They are expected to remain obligatory after that date only in hospitals, retirement homes and on public transport.\n Easter Sunday this year falls on April 17 and most British families heading out to Spain this year will have returned home by the time the new rules on face masks come into force.\n Face masks became mandatory in all public spaces in Spain on May 20 two years ago, with their obligatory use outdoors only being lifted in February after restrictions were reintroduced around Christmas.\n Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez, addressing members of his left-wing PSOE party at the start of last month, said: \u201cWe have the lowest cumulative rate of coronavirus right now in Europe and soon, very soon, when our Health Minister says so, we\u2019ll be able to remove the mandatory status of face masks indoors.\u201d\n Experts in areas like the Costa Blanca, which includes the popular holiday resort of Benidorm, reacted by putting a timeline on the move of between three and five weeks.\n The use of face masks in public spaces indoors in Spain remains the most visible sign of the coronavirus pandemic.\n Virtually all other restrictions put in place at the height of the health crisis have already been lifted.\n Some experts have said they would prefer to see the current face masks rules remain in place until after the summer.\n The move to banish them from most parts of everyday life will be welcomed by many parents whose young children have had to wear them at school for hours on end for the last two years.\n Many Spaniards still use them outdoors despite the fact they are not obliged to do so.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

strategy based on \u201cdefence, deterrence and resilence\u201d.\n Liz Truss was due to deliver the landmark message at a working dinner of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels where she was also set to call for the West to quickly and decisively supply more weapons to Ukraine.\n For years, the UK and other European nations have sought to keep on engaging with Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime despite its numerous acts of aggression including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the 2018 Novichok poisonings in Salisbury.\n But the Foreign Secretary stressed Mr Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, where his forces have committed atrocities widely condemned as war crimes with thousands of civilians killed, meant this policy now had to be ditched.\n \u201cThe age of engagement with Russia is over,\u201d she was due to say.\n \u201cWe need a new approach to security in Europe based on resilience, defence and deterrence.\u201d\n The 1997 Nato-Russia Founding Act provided the formal basis for bilateral relations with Moscow, including by establishing the Nato-Russia Permanent Joint Council as a forum for consultation and co-operation.\n However, Ms Truss was expected to brand this as now \u201cdead\u201d and that it represented an out-dated approach to relations with the Kremlin.\n She also warned against raising hopes too much from Russian troops, having suffered heavy losses, being forced to pull back from around Kyiv and other parts of northern Ukraine.\n \u201cThere is no time for false comfort,\u201d she was expected to stress, as more details of the horrors committed by Russian troops in Bucha, near Kyiv, and other towns and cities are emerging.\n She was due to add: \u201cRussia is not retreating, but regrouping and repositioning to push harder in the East and South of Ukraine.\u201d\n The Cabinet minister was also set to call for the West to rapidly ramp up support to Ukraine, including by giving Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s military the weapons it needs to fight for the Russian president\u2019s invasion to fail, strengthening sanctions, and boosting defences so there are no \u201csecurity vacuums\u201d at the edge of Nato, such as in eastern Europe.\n She was also due to call for a rethink of support for countries \u201ccaught in the web of Russian influence\u201d such as Georgia, Moldova, Sweden and Finland.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":
