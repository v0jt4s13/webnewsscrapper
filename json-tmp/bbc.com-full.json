It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. \nYahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv and just outside the city of Chernihiv which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. \nWhen they entered, they took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. \nSixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. \nAs we climbed down a short flight of stairs, we began to smell the stench of disease and decay. The room was dirty - some mattresses, clothes, shoes and books were strewn on the floor, there were four small cots in the centre and a stash of utensils in one corner. \nMykola took us straight to the far end of the room. \n\"This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,\" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. \"I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this.\"\nMykola said you couldn't move at all for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive, including babies. The youngest was just two months old. \nRussian forces were quick to reach villages such as Yahidne as they launched their assault on Chernihiv. For weeks the city of about 300,000 people was cut off as Russian forces surrounded and bombed it, having met resistance. They also destroyed a bridge on the road to the capital Kyiv, leaving residents with nowhere to flee. \nNow the Russians have withdrawn following their failure to take Kyiv. The BBC is one of the first news organisations to reach the area and the horror of what happened under both occupation and bombardment can be revealed. So close to the border, people worry too that the Russians could soon return.\nFifteen-year-old Anastasiia was in the Yahidne basement along with her father and grandmother. \n\"There was barely any room. We were living sitting up. We were sleeping sitting up. Not that we slept at all. It was impossible. So many shells were landing around here. It was unbearable,\" she said.\nThe room had no ventilation. Its two windows were boarded up. \n\"During my time here, 12 people died,\" Mykola said. \nMost of them were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. \nWhen people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. Russian soldiers would not allow it every day. And because of the constant fighting outside - mortar shelling, explosions and gunfire - it was dangerous as well.\nThis meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside.\n\"It was very scary. I knew the people who died,\" says Anastasiia. \"They treated us very kindly. I felt so sad, they just died here for no reason.\"\n\"In normal conditions, they would not have died. Putin is a war criminal,\" said Mykola. \n\"My feet had begun to swell up. But I kept thinking to myself, I have to survive. I have to, for my daughter and two granddaughters.\"\nMost of the time people were not allowed to go out even to use a toilet. They were made to use buckets instead. \n\"Sometimes the soldiers took people out to use them as shields,\" Mykola said.\nThey were allowed to cook on open fires outside twice a day. The village had enough food stocks and a well for water. \nOne of the Russian soldiers told Mykola they had been told they would be in Ukraine for just four days, which would be enough to take over Kyiv. \nOn 3 April, the Russians withdrew from Yahidne. \nUkrainian soldiers are now in the village, and most of those who were trapped have been evacuated to areas nearby. \n\"I wake up many times every night. I feel like I can hear the sound of shooting. I run to my parents, scared,\" says Anastasiia. \nThe Russians occupied villages like Yahidne around Chernihiv in a bid to lay siege to the city and eventually take control of it. \nThey weren't able to enter the city, but there's been extensive destruction to many parts of it and officials say around 350 civilians have been killed.\nSince Russia's withdrawal from around Chernihiv, volunteers have been burying the dead. One part of the local graveyard is now entirely full of fresh graves, with a placard stuck in each, for the purpose of identification. \nFamilies who have been separated have been coming to see if they can find the grave of their loved ones. \nA local football stadium was bombed, Ukrainian officials say by Russian aircraft. A giant crater can be seen in the centre of the field where one bomb fell. Another destroyed a part of the stands, now a mangled mess of broken plastic seats and metal railings.\nNext to the stadium, a children's library housed in a historic building has also been badly damaged. \nAs we drove through the city, we passed several residential neighbourhoods which have been almost flattened. \nAt Novoselivka, in the north of Chernihiv, destruction is visible as far as the eye can see. \nPiles of stones and bricks lie where homes must have stood. We saw a child's pink winter jacket, a teddy bear, a stuffed elephant and pieces of Lego on one of the paths going into the residential area.\nAlong the way, we saw more bomb craters. \nA woman and child on bicycles gestured to us to follow them. \nSixty-two-year-old Nina Vynnyk and her grandson, 10-year-old Danylo, wanted to show us their home -  only a shell now, everything in and around it has been destroyed. \nNina's daughter and Danylo's mother, 39-year-old Ludmyla, has lost her leg and is in hospital.\nWhen Nina's home began to be shelled, they ran to another person's house hoping to seek shelter in their basement. But that was bombed too. \n\"We were knocked out by the explosion. Someone got a concussion, someone was injured. When we came to our senses, I saw that my daughter was screaming, 'Mummy, mummy I don't have a leg'. It was horrible,\" she said.\nLudmyla crawled to safety and was taken to a hospital. \n\"I feel like this is a terrible nightmare. It can't be true. Why didn't our government warn us? Why didn't they evacuate us,\" said Nina. \nFour generations of her family lived in the home. \"In one moment, there is nothing left. I don't know where I will live in the winter,\" she said.\nShe can't afford to pay for prosthetics for her daughter. \nOn Russian statements that they have not targeted civilians, she says, \"He [Putin] is full of lies. There is a woman in a hospital without a leg. That is the truth. \n\"Let Putin pay for her surgery. Let Putin build this house. He wanted it so much, didn't he? Let him pay for all of it now.\"\nAdditional reporting by Imogen Anderson, Anastasiia Levchenko and Daria Sipigina\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/20F6/production/_124083480_mykola.jpg", "alt": "Mykola Klymchuk"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0030/production/_124084000_mediaitem124083999.jpg", "alt": "basement in yahidne"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10200/production/_124084066_mediaitem124084005.jpg", "alt": "anastasia"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13842/production/_124083997_mediaitem124083996.jpg", "alt": "destroyed building in chernihiv"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/130E0/production/_124084087_mediaitem124084086.jpg", "alt": "chernihiv"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/112C2/production/_124083307_nina.jpg", "alt": "Nina"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-61028380", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Bucha murders: German report says Russian troops discussed killings"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 16:46:46"}, {"article_body": "Russian troops were heard discussing killing civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, in messages intercepted by German intelligence, German media say.\nDer Spiegel magazine says some of the radio traffic tracked by the BND intelligence agency appears to match locations of bodies just outside Kyiv. \nThe BND has so far made no public comments on the issue.\nUkraine says more than 300 civilians were killed by the Russians in Bucha - Moscow denies any involvement.\nRecent images of Bucha streets strewn with bodies have shocked the international community. Some of the victims appeared to have been shot in the back of the head after their hands were tied.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of genocide, an accusation flatly rejected by Moscow.\nWarning: This piece contains graphic images which some may find upsetting.\nBucha was seized by Russian troops soon after President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.\nAfter more than a month, the Russians eventually withdrew from Bucha, and Ukrainian forces soon entered the town.\nThe BND's intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday, Der Spiegel reported on Thursday.\nIn one intercepted radio message, the magazine said, Russian soldiers appeared to be talking about interrogating people and then shooting them. \nIn another, a soldier talked about shooting someone on a bike, which appeared to match a notorious photo showing a dead cyclist in Bucha. \nAccording to Spiegel, the intercepts also appeared to indicate that mercenaries from Russia's private Wagner group played a key role in the Bucha killings.\nAn unnamed security source told Reuters news agency: \"It's true that the [German] federal government has indications of Russian perpetration in Bucha\".\n\"However, these findings on Bucha refer to satellite images.

And she agreed with Republican senators about the importance of abiding by the text of the Constitution, as it was intended by the founders.  \nDuring her confirmation, Democrats touted her experience working as a public defender. She will be the first Supreme Court justice since Thurgood Marshall - the first black Supreme Court justice -  to have career experience representing criminal defendants.\nThe jurist, a Washington DC native, currently sits on the influential US court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. She worked as a public defender in Washington before joining a private practice prior to her judicial appointments.\nSome Republicans took issue with clients Ms Jackson took on as a public defence lawyer - namely terrorism suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, with some accusing her of being soft on crime.\nOthers, however, applauded the diversity of experience her legal career would bring to the bench over the course of what was at times highly fractious and almost entirely polarised six week confirmation process.\nSenator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of three Republicans to vote in favour of Justice Jackson said this decision rested, in part, as a \"rejection of the corrosive politicisation\" that has come to shape the confirmation process.\nThe new justice \"will bring to the Supreme Court a range of experience from the courtroom that few can match given her background in litigation,\" Ms Murkowski said. \nThe top court plays a crucial role in American public life and is often the last word on highly contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government. \nKetanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation is a historic one as the appointment of the first black female justice. It's also notable because her professional background differs markedly from recent justices. She is the first since Thurgood Marshall in 1967 to come to the court with extensive experience as a criminal defence attorney.\nA recent Cato Institute study found that throughout the federal court system, former prosecutors outnumber defence attorneys by four to one.\nSome conservatives have accused Ms Jackson of being \"soft\" on criminals, pointing to her experience as a public defender and willingness as a federal judge to issue prison sentences below federal guidelines. While her supporters vociferously dispute this, Ms Jackson is likely to bring a different perspective to the court, particularly on the criminal procedure cases that regularly appear on the docket.\nAs one of nine justices, replacing one of only three liberals on the court, her arrival may have a negligible impact on the court rulings. She has a lifetime appointment to assert her influence, however. And even if she's not penning majority rulings, that influence can come through private interactions with justices and through dissenting opinions that could preview new legal principles if the court's ideological balance someday shifts.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EA53/production/_124078995_kbjtop.jpg", "alt": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson at her confirmation hearing"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/27FB/production/_112953201__104759290_anthonyzurcher_tr-nc.png", "alt": "Analysis box by Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60991746", "page_details": [{"live_report": 1}, {"post_title": "Ukraine war latest: Battles in Donbas will look like World War Two, says Ukraine - BBC News"}, {"summary": "Summary:\n- The battle for the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine will remind the world of World War Two and involve thousands of tanks, Ukraine's foreign minister says\n- Dmytro Kuleba asks Nato allies to provide \"everything we need, and we will fight not only for our security, but for your security\"\n- Nato's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance is ready to strengthen support but does not provide details of weapons\n- Western officials and military analysts say they expect an intense Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine in the next few weeks\n- Residents in Yahidne, near Chernihiv, tell the BBC Russian troops held 130 people in a basement for four weeks - and 12 people died\n- The BBC has been told that Russian troops used villagers in northern Ukraine as human shields against counter-attacks\n- Meanwhile Russia is suspended from the UN Human Rights Council over alleged war crimes after a vote in New York"}, {"articles": [{"article": [{"post_date": "2022-04-07 21:20:00.000000"}, {"post_title": "Nobel winner says he was attacked on Russian train"}, {"post_body": " Russia's Nobel Peace Prize winning journalist Dmitry Muratov says he has been attacked with red paint laced with the solvent acetone on a train in Russia.

Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a \"strategic coffee break\". Western nations view Russia\u2019s suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive.  Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the council\u2019s own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bachelet\u2019s long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations?

Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accurate when he said the fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? \u201cYes I think that\u2019s accurate,\" Reynolds said. \"With all the forces freed up\nfrom the north of Ukraine\u2026 we\u2019re going to see a clash of arms on European soil\nthat hasn\u2019t been seen for generations.\" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east \u201cthe map has\nstill been slowly turning red\u201d, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north.  So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a \"significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite\", Reynolds says. Western arms will be \"absolutely essential\" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade drones could \u201cstart to change things on the ground within a short\ntimeframe\u201d \u2013 but there\u2019s \u201cvery little else\u201d that could do so, he adds.

Scientists wanted to find out when that risk returns to normal levels.\nThe researchers tracked the health of just over one million people who tested positive for Covid between February 2020 and May 2021 in Sweden, and compared them with four million people of the same age and sex who had not had a positive test.\nAfter a Covid infection, they found an increased risk of:\nWhen the researchers compared the risks of blood clots after Covid to the normal level of risk, they found that:\nThe study, published in the BMJ, said the raised risk of blood clots was higher in the first wave than later waves, probably because treatments improved during the pandemic and older patients were starting to be vaccinated by the second wave.\nThe risk of a blood clot in the lung in people who were very seriously ill with Covid was 290 times greater than normal, and seven times higher than normal after mild Covid. But there was no raised risk of internal bleeding in mild cases.\n\"For unvaccinated individuals, that's a really good reason to get a vaccine - the risk is so much higher than the risk from vaccines,\" says Anne-Marie Fors Connolly, principal study investigator from Umea University in Sweden.\nThe researchers can't prove that Covid caused the blood clots in this study but they have several theories on why it happens.\nIt could be the direct effect of the virus on the layer of cells which line blood vessels, an exaggerated inflammatory response to the virus, or the body making blood clots at inappropriate times.\nVaccines are very effective against severe Covid, but offer less protection against infection, particularly with the Omicron variant - meaning repeat infections with symptoms are common as countries work out how to live with Covid.\nFrederick K Ho, public health lecturer from the University of Glasgow, said this study \"reminds us of the need to remain vigilant to the complications associated with even mild [Covid] infection, including thromboembolism\".\nThe risk of blood clots goes up after vaccination, but \"the magnitude of risk remains smaller and persists for a shorter period than that associated with infection\", he adds.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1008C/production/_124067656_gettyimages-1303391123.jpg", "alt": "Doctors treating a Covid patient in ICU"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-61013740", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Tanis: Fossil of dinosaur killed in asteroid strike found, scientists claim"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-06 20:59:26"}, {"article_body": "Scientists have presented a stunningly preserved leg of a dinosaur.\nThe limb, complete with skin, is just one of a series of remarkable finds emerging from the Tanis fossil site in the US State of North Dakota.\nBut it's not just their exquisite condition that's turning heads - it's what these ancient specimens are purported to represent.\nThe claim is the Tanis creatures were killed and entombed on the actual day a giant asteroid struck Earth.\nThe day 66 million years ago when the reign of the dinosaurs ended and the rise of mammals began.\nVery few dinosaur remains have been found in the rocks that record even the final few thousand years before the impact. To have a specimen from the cataclysm itself would be extraordinary.\nThe BBC has spent three years filming at Tanis for a show to be broadcast on 15 April, narrated by Sir David Attenborough.\nSir David will review the discoveries, many that will be getting their first public viewing. \nAlong with that leg, there are fish that breathed in impact debris as it rained down from the sky.\nWe see a fossil turtle that was skewered by a wooden stake; the remains of small mammals and the burrows they made; skin from a horned triceratops; the embryo of a flying pterosaur inside its egg; and what appears to be a fragment from the asteroid impactor itself.\n\"We've got so many details with this site that tell us what happened moment by moment, it's almost like watching it play out in the movies. You look at the rock column, you look at the fossils there, and it brings you back to that day,\" says Robert DePalma, the University of Manchester, UK, graduate student who leads the Tanis dig.\nIt's now widely accepted that a roughly 12km-wide space rock hit our planet to cause the last mass extinction.\nThe impact site has been identified in the Gulf of Mexico, off the Yucatan Peninsula. That's some 3,000km away from Tanis, but such was the energy imparted in the event, its devastation was felt far and wide.\nThe North Dakota fossil site is a chaotic jumble.\nThe remains of animals and plants seem to have been rolled together into a sediment dump by waves of river water set in train by unimaginable earth tremors. Aquatic organisms are mixed in with the land-based creatures.\nThe sturgeon and paddlefish in this fossil tangle are key. They have small particles stuck in their gills. These are the spherules of molten rock kicked out from the impact that then fell back across the planet. The fish would have breathed in the particles as they entered the river.\nThe spherules have been linked chemically and by radiometric dating to the Mexican impact location, and in two of the particles recovered from preserved tree resin there are also tiny inclusions that imply an extra-terrestrial origin.\n\"When we noticed there were inclusions within these little glass spherules, we chemically analysed them at the Diamond X-ray synchrotron near Oxford,\" explains Prof Phil Manning, who is Mr DePalma's PhD supervisor at Manchester.\n\"We were able to pull apart the chemistry and identify the composition of that material. All the evidence, all of the chemical data, from that study suggests strongly that we're looking at a piece of the impactor; of the asteroid that ended it for the dinosaurs.\"\nThe existence of Tanis, and the claims made for it, first emerged in the public sphere in the New Yorker Magazine in 2019. This caused a furore at the time.\nScience usually demands the initial presentation of new discoveries is made in the pages of a scholarly journal. A few peer-reviewed papers have now been published, and the dig team promises many more as it works through the meticulous process of extracting, preparing and describing the fossils.\nTo make its TV programme, the BBC called in outside consultants to examine a number of the finds.\nProf Paul Barrett from London's Natural History Museum looked at the leg. He's an expert in ornithischian (mostly plant-eating) dinosaurs.\n\"It's a Thescelosaurus. It's from a group that we didn't have any previous record of what its skin looked like, and it shows very conclusively that these animals were very scaly like lizards. They weren't feathered like their meat-eating contemporaries.\n\"This looks like an animal whose leg has simply been ripped off really quickly. There's no evidence on the leg of disease, there are no obvious pathologies, there's no trace of the leg being scavenged, such as bite marks or bits of it that are missing,\" he tells me.\n\"So, the best idea that we have is that this is an animal that died more or less instantaneously.\"\nThe big question is whether this dinosaur did actually die on the day the asteroid struck, as a direct result of the ensuing cataclysm. The Tanis team thinks it very likely did, given the limb's position in the dig sediments.\nIf that is the case, it would be quite the discovery.\nBut Prof Steve Brusatte from University of Edinburgh says he's sceptical - for the time being.\nHe's acted as another of the BBC's outside consultants. He wants to see the arguments presented in more peer-reviewed articles, and for some palaeo-scientists with very specific specialisms to go into the site to give their independent assessment.\nProf Brusatte says it's possible, for example, that animals that had died before the impact were exhumed by the violence on the day and then re-interred in a way that made their deaths appear concurrent.\n\"Those fish with the spherules in their gills, they're an absolute calling card for the asteroid. But for some of the other claims - I'd say they have a lot circumstantial evidence that hasn't yet been presented to the jury,\" he says.\n\"For some of these discoveries, though, does it even matter if they died on the day or years before? The pterosaur egg with a pterosaur baby inside is super-rare; there's nothing else like it from North America. It doesn't all have to be about the asteroid.\"\nThere's no doubting the pterosaur egg is special.\nWith modern X-ray technology it's possible to determine the chemistry and properties of the egg shell. It was likely leathery rather than hard, which may indicate the pterosaur mother buried the egg in sand or sediment like a turtle.\nIt's also possible with X-ray tomography to extract virtually the bones of the pterosaur chick inside, to print them and reconstruct what the animal would have looked like. Mr DePalma has done this.\nThe baby pterosaur was probably a type of azhdarchid, a group of flying reptiles whose adult wings could reach more than 10m from tip to tip.\nMr DePalma gave a special lecture on the Tanis discoveries to an audience at the US space agency Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center on Wednesday. He and Prof Manning will also present their latest data to the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in May.\nDinosaurs: The Final Day with Sir David Attenborough will be broadcast on BBC One on 15 April at 18:30 BST.

There are no official statistics but it is estimated 100,000 Koreans are addicted to sleeping pills. \nWhen they still can't sleep they often resort to drinking alcohol on top of the medication - with dangerous consequences. \n''People sleep walk. They go to the refrigerator and eat a lot of things unconsciously, including uncooked food,'' Dr Lee says. ''There were even cases of car accidents in the centre of Seoul caused by a sleepwalking patient.'' \nDr Lee is used to seeing chronic insomniacs suffering from what is known as hypo-arousal. Some of her patients tell her it has been decades since they have slept for more than a few hours a night.  \n''They cry [but] still hold a single thread of hope [when they come here]. It's a really sad situation,'' she says. \nSouth Korea is one of the most sleep deprived nations on earth. It also has the highest suicide rate among developed nations, the highest consumption of hard liquor and a huge number of people on antidepressants. \nThere are historic reasons for these statistics.  \nIn just a few decades the country has gone from being one of the poorest countries on earth to one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. It also wields considerable soft power, with its growing influence on pop culture.  \nNations with a similar trajectory, like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, could tap into their natural resources, but Korea has no such hidden wealth. It transformed itself through the sheer dedication of a population driven by a collective nationalism pushing them to work harder and faster. \nOne result is that its people are overworked, stressed out and sleep deprived. \nNow, an entire industry has grown around catering to those who can't sleep - with the sleep industry estimated to be worth $2.5bn in 2019.  \nIn Seoul, whole department stores are devoted to sleep products, from the perfect sheets to the optimum pillow, while pharmacies offer shelves full of herbal sleep remedies and tonics. \nAnd then there are the tech approaches to insomnia. A little over two years ago Daniel Tudor started a meditation app - Kokkiri - aimed at helping stressed out young Koreans.  \nAlthough Korea is historically a Buddhist country, young people think of meditation as an old person's pastime, not something an office worker in Seoul might do. Daniel says he had to re-import and re-package meditation as a Western idea for young Koreans to find it attractive. \nMore traditional institutions have also joined in on the action. \nHyerang Sunim is a Buddhist nun who helps run a Temple-Stay retreat on the edge of Seoul where the sleep-deprived can engage in meditation and absorb Buddhist teachings. \nIn the past these kinds of mini-breaks were reserved for retirees who wanted teachings and prayer. Now the participants tend to be younger, working-age Koreans. But these same Buddhist temples have also been criticised for making a profit from such retreats.  \n''Of course there are concerns\u2026 but I think the benefits outweigh them,'' said Hyerang Sunim. \n''Traditionally it has been rare to see young people come and seek the Buddhist teachings. And they are getting a lot out of their interactions with the temple stay.'' \nLee Hye-ri, who attended one such Buddhist retreat after the pressure at work became too much, says she has learned to take responsibility for her stress. \n''Everything starts from me, all problems start with me. That's what I learned here.'' \nBut framing the solution to stress and sleep deprivation as something to be dealt with at the individual level can be problematic.\nThose who believe the problem is caused by an unreasonable work culture and societal pressures have criticised this individualistic approach saying it is tantamount to victim-blaming. These critics say meditation or relaxation is a sticking plaster and that real solutions can only come about through fundamental changes to society. \nJi-Eun was eventually so sleep deprived and stressed that she quit her job. These days she works far more reasonable hours as a freelancer and the pandemic means she can work from home. She has also sought professional help at Dr Lee's sleep clinic to manage her insomnia.  \n''What's the point of working so hard now that we've made it as a country?'' Ji-Eun says. ''We should be able to relax.'' \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5550/production/_123704812_gettyimages-55746129.jpg", "alt": "Elderly South Korean job seekers sleep during an elderly persons' job fair on September 23, 2005 in Seoul, South Korea."}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13BC8/production/_123704808_drsleepclinic.jpg", "alt": "Female doctor stands in front of a reception desk with the sign Dream Sleep Clinic glowing in the background"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A370/production/_123704814_gettyimages-1208680280.jpg", "alt": "Office workers wearing face masks amid concerns over the COVID-19 novel coronavirus walk past blossoms during their lunch break in central Seoul on March 31, 2020."}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EDA8/production/_123704806_templestay.jpg", "alt": "A group of men and women sit cross-legged facing a monk in a sparsely-decorated room in a Buddhist temple"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-61021460", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Oil giant Shell to take \u00a33.8bn hit by leaving Russia"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 09:18:35"}, {"article_body": "Oil giant Shell has confirmed it will take a hit of up to $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) from offloading its Russian assets as part of plans to withdraw from the country.\nThe firm has pledged to no longer buy oil, but contracts signed before the invasion of Ukraine will be fulfilled.\nThe costs of Shell no longer doing business in Russia include quitting joint ventures with Gazprom.\nShell was criticised when it bought Russian crude oil at a cheap price shortly after the war began.\nIn response to the outrage, the company apologised and pledged to stop buying oil from Russia.\nThe company said it would cost between $4bn and $5bn to cut ties with the country.\n\"Shell has not renewed longer-term contracts for Russian oil, and will only do so under explicit government direction, but we are legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion,\" the company said.\nThe oil firm added that the state of the global oil markets remained \"volatile\".\nBrent Crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - was trading at about $100 a barrel early on Thursday, but its price has risen to record levels since the war in the Ukraine.\nThe rise in oil prices is due to Russia being one of the world's largest exporters of the commodity and fears of supplies being disrupted because of the conflict.\nThough the UK gets very little of its oil from Russia, it has been affected by the global rise in prices, which has seen petrol and diesel prices hit record levels.\nAs part of Shell's withdrawal plans, the company said previously it would offload a 27.5% stake in a Russian liquefied natural gas facility, a 50% stake in an oilfield project in Siberia and an energy joint venture.\nIt will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, which has been put on hold by ministers in Berlin.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F62C/production/_123602036_bloke.png", "alt": "Worker at Shell petrol station in Russia"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-61027374", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Canada proposes foreign buyers home real estate ban"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 20:20:46"}, {"article_body": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has proposed a two-year ban on some foreigners buying homes.\nThe measure comes as the country grapples with some of the worst housing affordability issues in the world.\nPrices have jumped more than 20%, pushing the average home in Canada to nearly C$817,000 ($650,000; \u00a3495,000) -  more than nine times household income.\nBut industry analysts say it's not clear a ban on foreign buyers will address the problem.\nData on purchases by foreign buyers in Canada is limited, but research suggests they amount for a small fraction of the market.\n\"I don't think\u00a0it's going to have a huge\u00a0impact,\" said Ben Myers, president of advisory firm Bullpenn Research & Consulting in Toronto, who found foreigners accounted for just 1% of purchases in 2020, down from 9% in 2015 and 2016.\n\"It's a fairly low number and let's face it, the people that really want to buy ... are going to find alternative ways to do it.\"\nMr Myers said the soaring housing costs reflect strong population growth and a shortage of supply, due in part to rules that restrict development.\nThe issues have worsened since the pandemic hit in 2020, when policymakers in Canada and elsewhere slashed interest rates to stabilise the economy, lowering borrowing costs and boosting demand even further.\nThe moves have fuelled the soaring housing prices seen in many markets around the world, but in Canada the disconnect between home prices and incomes is one of the most dramatic, according to OECD data.\nMr Trudeau pledged to tackle housing affordability during his campaign for election last year.\nIn addition to the temporary ban on foreign buyers, the budget proposal his government unveiled on Thursday sets aside billions to spur new construction and proposes new programmes, such as a tax-free savings account for first-time buyers. \nMr Trudeau has also discussed banning certain bidding processes that favour investors, who by some measures have accounted for about one in five homes purchased in Canada since 2014.\nThe proposed ban on foreign buyers would exempt permanent residents and foreign students and workers, as well as those buying their primary residence. \nThe proposal builds on actions such as special taxes that some parts of Canada have already taken against out-of-town and foreign buyers.\nIn Ontario, for example, provincial Premier Doug Ford recently announced plans to raise an existing tax on foreign buyers from 15% to 20% and expand it beyond Toronto to the entire province.\nWhile foreign purchases are not the driver of the affordability issues, taxing them at least captures revenue that can be re-deployed to address such problems, said Steve Pomeroy, head of Focus Consulting, a housing policy firm.\n\"If you ban them, you don't really have much of an impact on suppressing rising home prices and you give up the revenue,\" he said.\nNew Zealand introduced a similar measure banning foreign buyers in 2018.\n\"It's good politics because it's easy to blame a victim that nobody cares about,\" Mr Pomeroy added. \"I don't think it will have much of an impact.\" \nPaul Kershaw, professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of Generation Squeeze, also said he saw little in  Mr Trudeau's proposal likely to slow price increases or significantly address affordability.\n\"It's not clear the housing measures will be sufficient to break Canada's addiction to high and rising home prices,\" he said, noting that for existing homeowners, the high prices help amass wealth.\nMr Pomeroy said he does expect price appreciation to slow in coming months, as the central bank raises interest rates. The Canadian housing market is particularly susceptible to such moves, since many buyers rely on five-year mortgages rather than the long-term ones common in the US and UK.\nBut higher interest rates will only make it less affordable for prospective buyers trying to break into the market, he warned.\nMr Myers said over the long-term, he expects hot markets such as Toronto and Vancouver to become dominated by renters, as regular buyers get priced out of the market, unless politicians address supply.\nBut Mr Pomeroy said high development costs means that adding supply will not necessarily reduce prices, unless the additions are dramatic.\n\"Unless you've got born into the right family ... the prospects for young buyers are quite dim,\" he said.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/941E/production/_124081973_whatsubject.jpg", "alt": "Justin Trudeau has promised to address Canada's soaring home prices"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-61019241", "page_details": [{"post_title": "China lockdowns: Tourism spending plunges over key holiday"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 05:00:07"}, {"article_body": "Tourism spending in China plunged during this week's Qingming festival, as the world's second largest economy battles a rise in infections.\nThe amount tourists spent during the key three-day holiday was more than 30% lower than the same time last year, official figures show.\nIt comes as travel restrictions in China continue, and Shanghai and other cities remain locked down. \nShanghai is the largest city to go into lockdown to date.\nThe Qingming festival, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day, is usually a time when people visit the graves of family and friends to pay their respects.\nThis would often mean people travelling from their homes to other parts of China, which can provide a boost for consumer spending.\nThe festival took place from Sunday 3 April to Tuesday 5 April this year. \nLocal tourists spent 18.78bn yuan ($2.95bn; \u00a32.26bn) over the three days, according to China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism.

Some environmentalists say it's too dear and too dangerous. They ridicule the idea from some politicians that every city could have its own mini reactor. \nBut other climate campaigners believe nuclear must be part of the energy mix.\nThe new strategy says the government wants to \"lead the world once again\" in nuclear power, reversing what it describes as \"decades of underinvestment\". \nThe government announced that a new body called Great British Nuclear will be launched to bolster the UK's nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 24 GW of electricity will come from that source - 25% of the projected electricity demand.\nThe focus on nuclear could deliver up to eight new reactors to be built on existing sites.\nThe government hopes to have a new reactor approved each year until 2030 with the aim to have them up and running by 2050.\nIt also confirmed advanced plans to approve two new reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk during this parliament.\nWylfa in Anglesey and Oldbury in South Gloucestershire have also been named as candidates to host either large-scale plants, smaller modular nuclear reactors, or possibly both. The Great British Nuclear body will identify other appropriate sites. \nTom Greatrex, boss of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the plans marked a \"vital step forward\" for the UK to meet its climate goals, and could create thousands of jobs.\n\"The ambition and determination to do much more and quicker is very welcome,\" he said.\nThe government said it would reform planning rules to cut approval times for new offshore wind farms, with the ambition that by 2030 more than half of the UK's renewable capacity will be wind.\nFor onshore wind, the strategy commits to consulting on developing partnerships with \"a limited number of supportive communities\" who want to host wind turbines in exchange for guaranteed lower energy bills. \nHowever, the strategy says there will be no \"wholesale changes\" to current planning regulations for onshore wind. \nAlthough it is one of the cheapest forms of energy, new onshore wind projects have been declining since 2015 when the government ended subsidies and introduced stricter planning rules in response to some complaints that wind turbines were an eyesore and noisy.\nDefending the decision not to prioritise onshore wind, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK already had about 30GW of onshore wind capacity.\nSpeaking at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, he said onshore wind farms were \"controversial\" because of their visual impact and new sites \"will have a very high bar to clear\". \nMr Johnson said the strategy was about \"tackling the mistakes of the past and making sure that we are set well for the future\". \nCiting policies including a \u00a36bn energy efficiency fund and support for heat pumps, he said the government was \"already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more\".\nBut Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the strategy as \"too little\" and \"too late\" to help people with rising costs. \n\"All we've got today is a cobbled-together list of things that could and should have been done over the last 10 to 12 years and it doesn't even tackle really important things like insulating homes, which could save \u00a3400 on everybody's bill,\" he said. \nGreen Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said it \"did not serve the needs of people or the climate\".\nMr Ramsay suggested that if the government was \"concerned about energy bills and taking real climate action, it would be going even further on onshore wind\". \nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the plans as \"utterly hopeless\", while the SNP's Stephen Flynn called it a \"missed opportunity\".\nFormer Ofgem boss Dermot Nolan said: \"Most of these decisions will take a long time to have an impact and in the short run we will continue to be dependent on fossil fuels.\"\nHe said the lack of focus on energy efficiency, on insulation, on improving the quality of people's homes \"is an opportunity missed\". \nDr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit said:  \"This is an immediate problem that needs solutions now, and this doesn't do anything on prices.\"\n\"It tries to do some things on energy supply, but they're all medium to long-term measures.

This was because only a very limited number of supporters made the effort to arrange to get them sent out in the post.\nOn other occasions, clubs have had to pulp thousands of copies of programmes after games were postponed at short notice due to a coronavirus outbreak.\nAs a result, a growing number of teams in England and Scotland have now stopped producing physical programmes. These include Hibernian from the Scottish Premiership, and five sides from the Championship, England's second tier - Blackburn Rovers, Bristol City, Derby County, Reading, and Swansea City.\nHibernian and Derby have instead moved to a regular club magazine, and Blackburn, Bristol City and Swansea have switched to publishing online versions of the matchday programme.\nMr Matz says the problem is that the days when printed programmes were the only way for clubs to directly communicate with fans are long gone. In this ever more digital world teams now have websites, numerous social media accounts, plus even their own TV stations for the largest clubs.\nHowever, he points out that the vast majority of clubs are still selling physical programmes. \"Big championship clubs like Blackburn and Swansea going over to digital programmes has made headline news, but the fact is the majority of clubs still put out hard copies.\"\nTeams in the English Football League could choose to stop selling physical programmes after a 2018 ruling that ended their obligation to do so.\nSwansea City went down the digital-only route from the start of the current 2021-22 season. The previous two seasons were transitional ones, with the Welsh club introducing a digital programme, but also physical copies for those supporters wishing to buy them.\nNow, the digital programme is available for fans to download free from the club website before home games. Season ticket holders and supporters club members also receive it by email.\nThe club says going digital offers \"all the elements provided by a printed programme\", plus the added ability to link to highlights clips and other video. \nA club spokesman adds it also removes printing costs, while later digital deadlines allow more up-to-date information, and there is also no need to discard printed programmes if a game is postponed.\nHe adds that the move to a digital programme was mainly precipitated by a decline in printed sales, and income, each season over the past decade. Although sales did go up in their first, historic, Premier League season, in 2011/12.\n\"With most things being online now, we felt that it was the right move for us as a club, and we have plans to improve our digital offering even further next season and strive to give our supporters as much quality content as possible,\" says the spokesman. \"[Yet] there is no doubt that some supporters would prefer a physical copy, as such items are considered collectables.\"\nFor those Swansea fans there is good news, as at the end of this season they will be able to buy a complete physical set of the 2021/22 home programmes for \u00a369. \nDavid Cottrell, programme editor for Premier League club Liverpool, says \"people still have this desire for a printed programme, it is our staple bread and butter\".\nHe adds: \"Programmes are still popular and more so when the team is doing well, when we see big increases in sales.\n\"Also, when it is a big historic occasion, people want something they can hold, touch, flick through. You might not get that tangible feeling on the internet or on a phone.\"\nNew Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.\nWhile Liverpool does also provide the programmes digitally, Mr Cottrell says that the extensive historical content - including archive photos - found in many programmes nowadays, as well as longer-form interviews, work better in print.\nMr Cottrell, who works for publisher Reach Sports, adds that print numbers vary according to visiting opposition, with more produced for Everton or Manchester United than Brighton or Norwich.\nTwo memorable Liverpool programmes from recent years were for the 2019 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona, with its mural-style cover, and the sell-out programme for the last home match of the 2019/20 championship-winning season, against Chelsea. The latter sold 60,000 initially and had a second print run.\nMr Cottrell adds: \"We can't compete with the speed and accessibility of social media on breaking news, but we can think differently about what we put in the programme, and we have two exclusive columns - by manager Jurgen Klopp and captain Jordan Henderson.\"\nThe future of the printed football programme may be more secure at the non-league levels of the game, where clubs get gates in the hundreds or thousands.\nElsa Jones has been marketing manager of Isthmian League club, Hanwell Town, for the past two years.\nAs well as overseeing a paper programme for every game, she also produces the west London club's digital presence on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\nThe club's programme print run varies from between 75 and 100 for each game, depending on the estimated away support.\n\"Nine out of ten times we sell out, or we will have maybe a maximum of five programmes left,\" says Ms Jones.\n\"I know there is talk of a move towards [a] digital programme, and they are becoming a lot more popular. But I think - if you are going to produce the programme, why not print it as well?\"\nShe says that as well as the programme promoting Hanwell Town's presence and history, it also brings in a valuable source of revenue through advertising.\nThe only downside the club has experienced with paper programmes, was with four postponed home games during the 2021-22 winter. It meant the club was left with unused printed programmes from those games.\n\"We can't afford to throw them in the bin and print new programmes, so we put inside an updated insert sheet, and put a sticker with the new match date over the old one,\" Ms Jones says.\nProgramme Monthly's Mr Matz says he is upbeat about the future of printed programmes. \"Clubs are thinking more about programme content, and I think they recognise there is still a strong demand for them.\"\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2781/production/_124031101_gettyimages-1196331126.jpg", "alt": "Football programmes for sale outside of Brighton's American Express Community Stadium"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17D4D/production/_124031679_gettyimages-1372942624.jpg", "alt": "Old football programmes for sale"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9173/production/_124053273_paulmatzperrygroves.jpg", "alt": "Paul Matz (left) with former Arsenal player Perry Groves"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/92ED/production/_124031673_done-1.jpg", "alt": "Swansea have gone from physical programmes, left, to a digital ones, right"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9CB1/production/_124031104_gettyimages-1075666728.jpg", "alt": "A Fulham FC programme seller"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png", "alt": "Presentational grey line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/650/cpsprodpb/B2CC/production/_114827754_banner2.png", "alt": "New Economy"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png", "alt": "Presentational grey line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/111E1/production/_124031107_davidcottrelllfc.jpg", "alt": "David Cottrell"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/185F3/production/_124072899_07cc6332-18ee-4e63-bb29-b066c5da7ef7.jpg", "alt": "Liverpool still produces physical match-day programmes"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/039F/production/_124072900_08ac9ff7-bab6-4deb-80bb-4e071831ee12.jpg", "alt": "Elsa Jones"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-61026912", "page_details": [{"post_title": "South America: More than 100 animals released back into Colombian wild"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 15:19:43"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-60431246", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Storm Eunice: Videos show winds toppling trees and ripping roofs"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-18 20:15:12"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-australia-60418525", "page_details": [{"post_title": "The dogs keeping gulls away from seaside diners in Sydney"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-17 13:09:58"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-61015050", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Ukraine's dream of a Eurovision win"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-06 23:01:01"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61023229", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Video captures couple driving through South Carolina storm"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 09:19:40"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-40358825", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Boris Johnson struggles in interview"}, {"post_date": "2017-06-21 20:56:08"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40362067", "page_details": [{"post_title": "North America prepares for August solar eclipse"}, {"post_date": "2017-06-21 22:00:29"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-australia-40365981", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Koalas 'facing extinction' in some Australian states"}, {"post_date": "2017-06-22 10:20:06"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40366136", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Video 'shows destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri'"}, {"post_date": "2017-06-22 10:18:12"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-40360168", "page_details": [{"post_title": "'Devil wheel' rider: It makes me happy"}, {"post_date": "2017-06-21 23:14:12"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-61007121", "page_details": [{"post_title": "War in Ukraine: Giving Russia money for energy is 'blood money' -

The hope is that maybe this result is going to be the one that breaks the dam.\n\"The famous astronomer Carl Sagan said 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence'. We believe we have that.\"\nThe scientists at the Fermilab Collider Detector (CDF) in Illinois have found only a tiny difference in the mass of the W Boson compared with what the theory says it should be - just 0.1%. But if confirmed by other experiments, the implications are enormous. The so-called Standard Model of particle physics has predicted the behaviour and properties of sub-atomic particles with no discrepancies whatsoever for fifty years. Until now.\nCDF's other co-spokesperson, Prof Georgio Chiarelli, from INFN Sezione di Pisa, told BBC News that the research team could scarcely believe their eyes when they saw the results.\n\"No-one was expecting this. We thought maybe we got something wrong.\" But the researchers have painstakingly gone through their results and tried to look for errors. They found none.\nThe result, published in the journal Science, could be related to hints from other experiments at Fermilab and the Large Hadron Collider at the Swiss-French border. These, as yet unconfirmed results, also suggest deviations from the Standard Model, possibly as a result of an as yet undiscovered fifth force of nature at play.\nPhysicists have known for some time that the theory needs to be updated. It can't explain the presence of invisible material in space, called Dark Matter, nor the continued accelerating expansion of the Universe by a force called Dark Energy. Nor can it explain gravity.\nDr Mitesh Patel of Imperial College, who works at the LHC, believes that if the Fermilab result is confirmed, it could be the first of many new results that could herald the biggest shift in our understanding of the Universe since Einstein's theories of relativity more than a hundred years ago. \n\"The hope is that these cracks will turn into chasms and eventually we will see some spectacular signature that not only confirms that the Standard Model has broken down as a description of nature, but also give us a new direction to help us understand what we are seeing and what the new physics theory looks like.\n\"If this holds, there have to be new particles and new forces to explain how to make these data consistent\".\nBut the excitement in the physics community is tempered with a loud note of caution. Although the Fermilab result is the most accurate measurement of the mass of the W boson to date, it is at odds with two of the next most accurate measurements from two separate experiments which are in line with the Standard Model.\n\"This will ruffle some feathers\", says Prof Ben Allanach, a theoretical physicist at Cambridge University.\n\"We need to know what is going on with the measurement. The fact that we have two other experiments that agree with each other and the Standard Model and strongly disagree with this experiment is worrying to me\".\nAll eyes are now on the Large Hadron Collider which is due to restart its experiments after a three-year upgrade. The hope is that these will provide the results which will lay the foundations for a new more complete theory of physics.\n\"Most scientists will be a little bit cautious,\" says Dr Patel. \n\"We've been here before and been disappointed, but we are all secretly hoping that this is really it, and that in our lifetime we might see the kind of transformation that we have read about in history books.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D83B/production/_124055355_cdfdetector01-0060-06-hr.jpg", "alt": "Fermilab Collider Detector"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ADCC/production/_100629444_mediaitem100629443.jpg", "alt": "Fermilab"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/921F/production/_117670473_201802-025_01.jpg", "alt": "LHCb in 2018"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-61024415", "page_details": [{"post_title": "David McKee: Mr Benn and Elmer author dies aged 87"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 12:24:46"}, {"article_body": "David McKee, the children's author and illustrator known for the Mr Benn series, has died at the age of 87.\nThe Devon-born writer, who also created Elmer the Patchwork Elephant and Not Now, Bernard, sold more than 10 million books around the world.\nIn a statement, his publisher Andersen Press announced the \"beloved\" author's death \"with great sadness\".\n\"All at Andersen Press hope his spirit lives on for many more generations through his joyful, heartfelt stories.\"\nMcKee's character Mr Benn famously wore a black suit and bowler hat and went on a series of adventures.\nIn each story, Mr Benn visited a fancy dress store and tried on a different outfit, before leaving the shop through a magic door and going on a journey related to his costume.\nThe concept was later adapted as an animated television series, originally transmitted by the BBC in the early 1970s.\nElmer the Patchwork Elephant was also made into a TV series, as well as a stage play.\nMcKee also illustrated books written by other authors, such as some of the later Paddington Bear books and Forrest Wilson's Super Gran.\nTributes have been paid by fans and fellow writers, including Philip Ardagh, who said it was \"very sad news\".\nAuthor and illustrator James Mayhew said McKee was \"such a gentle, modest, generous man, who leaves an astonishing legacy, covering themes of acceptance & pacifism, as relevant today as ever\".\nFred Blunt wrote on Twitter: \"He has been an inspiration to me for as long as I can remember.\"\nThe Centre for Literacy in Primary Education tweeted that \"his contributions to children's literature are such a wonderful legacy to leave behind\".\nChildren's charity Kidscape commented: \"His books highlighted diversity & inclusivity & he will be missed.\"\nChildren's book reviewer Imogen Russell Williams said McKee's \"work, full of bold flat colour and subversive wit, is simply unforgettable\", and had \"enriched small readers for decades\".\nAustralian TV personality and children's book blogger Brydon Coverdale said he was \"a wonderfully creative man\".\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5C05/production/_124075532_gettyimages-583661184.jpg", "alt": "David McKee"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/65DD/production/_124077062_shutterstock_171783308.jpg", "alt": "Mr Benn postage stamp"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12545/production/_124077057_davidmckee.jpg", "alt": "David McKee with his Elmer book"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/technology-61009163", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Amazon secures rockets for broadband project"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-06 17:56:55"}, {"article_body": "Over the next five years, three new heavy-lift rockets will put thousands of satellites into low earth orbit as part of Amazon's Project Kuiper.\nThe project aims to provide broadband connections using a constellation of 3,236 satellites.\nRival Starlink is said to have more than 2,300 satellites in orbit already.\nThe rockets will be made by Arianespace, Blue Origin - which was founded by Amazon owner Jeff Bezos - and United Launch Alliance.\nAmazon says Project Kuiper aims to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband to customers including households, businesses, government agencies, disaster relief operations, mobile operators, and other organisations \"working in places without reliable internet connectivity\".\nLike Elon Musk's Starlink, users will connect to the internet via a terminal that communicates with the satellites.

This could mean less stringent testing for some workers.\nLonger-term, home-grown talent should be \"nurtured\", said the MPs, alongside the development of new technology.  \nIn a statement, Defra said it was looking at how new technology could be used in the sector. \nIt added: \"We fully acknowledge that the food and farming industry is facing labour challenges and we continue to work with the sector to mitigate them. \n\"We have given the industry greater certainty by enabling the seasonal workers scheme until the end of 2024, allowing overseas workers to come to the UK for up to six months to work in the horticulture sector. \n\"Our new points-based immigration system also expanded the skilled worker route to many more occupations, including butchers, who can now be recruited from anywhere in the world.\" \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C85F/production/_124059215_mediaitem124059212.jpg", "alt": "Pig in farm"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4595/production/_124031871_strawberrypickers.jpg", "alt": "Romanian strawberry picker"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-61009456", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Bafta Games Awards 2022: 'Plucky underdogs' go up against hit titles"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-06 23:30:45"}, {"article_body": "Hit games like Forza Horizon 5, Call of Duty and Fortnite will go up for prizes at the Bafta Games Awards later.\nThey will be joined by the likes of Overboard!, which was made in three months by a team of four people during the pandemic \"because they were bored\".\nOverboard! co-creator Jon Ingold said: \"It's really great that Bafta, widely recognised for the glamour of film and TV, shows all the sides of gaming.\"\nHis title is among the six nominees for the best British game award.\nOverboard! is a twist on an Agatha Christie-style whodunit.

So we started in July or August last year to dig deeper and to investigate this field,\" he says.\nIt took many months to locate which firm might be hosting Hydra in Germany. Ultimately it was found to be a so-called 'bullet-proof hosting' company.\nA bullet-proof hosting company is one that does not audit the websites or content it is hosting, and will happily host criminal websites and avoid police requests for information on customers.\nMr Zwiebel says his investigators then took their evidence to a German judge to get permission to approach the server company and issue a takedown notice.\nThe company was forced to comply otherwise they too could have been arrested. \nVisitors to the site are now greeted with a police poster saying \"the platform and the criminal content has been seized\".\nAlthough celebrating their success, German authorities say they fear this won't be the end of the Hydra cyber-crime group, unless they can find and arrest them.\n\"We know they will find another way to do their business. They will probably try to build a new platform, and we will have to keep our eye on it. We don't know the perpetrators, so that's the next step,\" says Mr Zwiebel.\nThe news comes during a turbulent time for darknet markets with the most prominent sites closing down  in recent months, either voluntarily or as a result of police activity.\nMany of the closures have come from criminals choosing to gradually bring their operations to a close, and disappear with their riches. \nIn January the administrators of UniCC, a darknet site selling stolen credit card details, retired, citing health reasons. \nVoluntary closures also brought to an end the White House Market in October 2021, Cannazon in November and Torrez in December. \nHowever, BBC research earlier this year revealed the most common way for darknet sites to close is via so-called 'exit scams' where the administrators voluntarily shut down the sites but steal their customer's funds in the process.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F393/production/_124055326_c505dd98-d1cf-4837-9d07-8453593c4576.jpg", "alt": "German cyber police at a server stack"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/141B3/production/_124055328_a1d921e6-b93b-46e1-9f38-c48b05561a6d.jpg", "alt": "Hydra market"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0D1B/production/_124055330_ad69b0ff-6397-4d25-a8a8-9a3652ecb609.jpg", "alt": "Hydra seizure notice"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61004345", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Ivanka Trump testifies to Capitol riot committee"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-06 01:55:13"}, {"article_body": "Former White House adviser Ivanka Trump testified for hours on Tuesday to the congressional committee investigating the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. \nMs Trump, 40, was asked for her account of her father's activities as the crisis unfolded.\nShe was one of several aides said to have tried to convince the president to condemn the violence.\nHer appearance comes days after her husband Jared Kushner, also an ex-White House adviser, met investigators.\nThe questioning lasted up to eight hours, US media reports.

Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic.\"\nThat sort of temperature rise would see our planet hit by \"unprecedented heatwaves, terrifying storms, and widespread water shortages\". \nTo avoid that fate, the world must keep the rise in temperatures at or under 1.5C this century, say researchers. \nThe good news is that this latest IPCC summary shows that it can be done, in what Mr Guterres calls a \"viable and financially sound manner\". \nBut keeping temperatures down will require massive changes to energy production, industry, transport, our consumption patterns and the way we treat nature. \nTo stay under 1.5C, according to the IPCC, means that carbon emissions from everything that we do, buy, use or eat must peak by 2025, and tumble rapidly after that, reaching net-zero by the middle of this century.\nTo put it in context, the amount of CO2 that the world has emitted in the last decade is the same amount that's left to us to stay under this key temperature threshold. \n\"I think the report tells us that we've reached the now-or-never point of limiting warming to 1.5C,\" said IPCC lead author Heleen De Coninck, who's Professor of Socio-Technical Innovation and Climate Change at Eindhoven University of Technology.\nSpeaking to BBC News she said: \"We have to peak our greenhouse gas emissions before 2025 and after that, reduce them very rapidly. \n\"And we will have to do negative emissions or carbon dioxide removal in the second half of the century, shortly after 2050, in order to limit warming to 1.5C.\"\nThe next few years are critical, say the researchers, because if emissions aren't curbed by 2030, it will make it nigh on impossible to limit warming later this century. \nKey to that in the short term will be how we generate energy. Luckily, solar panel and wind turbines have never been cheaper, having fallen in cost by around 85% over the past decade. \n\"It's game over for the fossil fuels that are fuelling both wars and climate chaos,\" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace, who was an observer at the IPCC approval session.\n\"There's no room for any new fossil fuel developments, and the coal and gas plants we already have need to close early.\"\nBut diets and lifestyles will also need changing, with huge scope for major carbon savings, according to the authors. \n\"Having the right policies, infrastructure and technology in place to enable changes to our lifestyles and behaviour can result in a 40-70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This offers significant untapped potential,\" said IPCC Co-chair Priyadarshi Shukla. \n\"The evidence also shows that these lifestyle changes can improve our health and wellbeing.\"\nIn practice, this means governments doing more to encourage walking and healthy eating, and putting in place the infrastructure for far more electric vehicles.\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the report concerns the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. \nThis can be done in a number of different ways, including through planting trees and making changes to farming practices. \nBut the report finds that to keep warming from going over the dangerous 1.5C threshold, we will need more than new forests. \nKeeping temperatures down will require machines to remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere.\nThis is very contentious as the technology is new and currently very expensive. \nSome participants in the IPCC process are highly sceptical that these approaches will work. \n\"The idea of quick emissions reductions and large negative emissions technologies are a concern,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from UCL, who was an observer in the approval session.\n\"There are a lot of pipe dreams in this report.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1C52/production/_124005270_gettyimages-1387534297.jpg", "alt": "turbines"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6A72/production/_124005272_gettyimages-1239586641.jpg", "alt": "drought"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B892/production/_124005274_gettyimages-1237728482.jpg", "alt": "cycling"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/106B2/production/_124005276_gettyimages-1239203556.jpg", "alt": "solar"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/technology-60922717", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Trump's Truth Social app branded a disaster"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-04 01:15:20"}, {"article_body": "In October, Donald Trump announced he was planning to launch a revolutionary technology company.\n\"I created Truth Social\u2026 to stand up to the tyranny of big tech,\" he said.\n\"We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter yet your favourite American president has been silenced.\"\nThe app launched on Presidents' Day, 21 February, but six weeks later is beset by problems.

Now they're the talk of Washington - here's why.\nIt all started with White House logs published by CBS News and The Washington Post, Donald Trump spent more than seven hours on 6 January, as the US Capitol was being attacked by a mob of his supporters, calling... no one.\nAt least, not officially.\nThat runs directly counter to multiple reports and first-hand accounts of presidential conversations that took place that day - including with Vice-President Mike Pence, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville.\nMr Tuberville has recounted how he spoke with the president at around 2:00 pm, informing him that the vice-president had been evacuated from the Capitol by Secret Service.\nThis raises the question of how the president was communicating with those at the scene of the riot. Did he borrow an aide's mobile device? \nOr was he, perhaps, using a \"burner phone\" - slang for low-cost, low-feature pay-as-you-go mobile phones that can be purchased without providing the kind of contact details necessary when signing a traditional wireless contract. \nIn a statement to the Washington Post, Mr Trump said that he had never heard of the term \"burner phone\" and had no idea what it was.\nHis assertion was quickly contradicted by John Bolton, the president's former national security advisor, who told CBS News that he and Mr Trump had spoken in the past of how burner phones could allow people to avoid having their calls scrutinised.\nBecause of the anonymity they provide, these phones - sold in the US by companies like Tracfone and Alcatel - have become popular among criminal elements and spouses seeking illicit love.\nAccording to the Mirriam-Webster dictionary website, the term \"burner\" as a word for disposable phones first began appearing in US popular culture in the mid-90s. It cites the lyrics from rapper Kingpin Skinny Pimp in One Life 2 Live: \"Talkin' on the burner phone, bumpin' hutch.\"\nThe slang first entered the mainstream American lexicon in the early 2000s, however, upon repeated usage in the HBO crime drama The Wire. The main characters disposed of their burner phones whenever they feared law enforcement was on their trail.\nThis isn't the first time the subject of unofficial phones has come up in connection with the former president. A 2018 New York Times story reported that the president frequently used as many as three iPhones to place calls to friends and aides - one of which was a personal device not secured by the US government.\n\"Mr. Trump typically relies on his cellphones when he does not want a call going through the White House switchboard and logged for senior aides to see,\" the New York Times reported. \"Many of those Mr. Trump speaks with most often on one of his cellphones, such as hosts at Fox News, share the president's political views, or simply enable his sense of grievance about any number of subjects.\"\nThe president, at the time, denied the story, calling it \"soooo wrong\".\nThe congressional committee investigating the 6 January Capitol attack has requested mobile phone records.\nIt is looking into why the White House logs appear to be incomplete and whether the president or his aides took steps to ensure that presidential communications were not recorded that day.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2747/production/_123955001_phones2_getty.jpg", "alt": "Pile of old phones"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/145A5/production/_123956338_trump_phone_976getty.jpg", "alt": "Trump using a cellphone"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-60737448", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Biodiversity: Pressure grows for deal to save nature"}, {"post_date": "2022-03-29 00:12:19"}, {"article_body": "A global agreement to reverse the loss of nature and halt extinctions is inching closer, as talks in Geneva enter their final day.\nInternational negotiators are working on the text of a UN framework to safeguard nature ahead of a high-level summit in China later this year.\nObservers have slammed the \"snail's pace\" of negotiations and are pressing for a strengthening of ambitions.\nDivisions remain, including over financing the plans.\n\"The science is very clear, we do not have any more time to waste; we need to take action now,\" Bernadette Fischler Hooper, head of international advocacy at WWF-UK, told BBC News. \n\"Not only on biodiversity loss, but also on climate change which is a very inter-linked issue. So that is what's at stake here; it's actually the future of the planet and its people.\"\nThe final version of the draft UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) will be negotiated in Kunming, China, at the Cop15 summit, which is expected to take place at the end of August.\nThe outcome will decide for the coming decades how the world will address the challenges of reducing the extinction risk threatening more than one million species, protecting 30% of land and sea, eliminating billions of dollars of environmentally-damaging government subsidies and restoring degraded ecosystems.\nTalks aimed at progressing the nascent agreement have been taking place in Geneva over the past two weeks.\nAfter the first week, observers hit out at what they saw as a \"glacial\" rate of progress, but momentum has gathered during the final days, although \"thorny issues\" remain, including the financing of the plans.\nThe draft text contains the aim to increase finance to at least US $200bn a year by 2030, with funding from developed to developing countries to increase by at least US $10bn a year.\n\"Resource mobilisation at this meeting has become a thorny issue,\" Ghanaian academic Alfred Oteng-Yeboah, who has played a key role in international efforts to protect biodiversity, told the news agency, AFP.\nOn subsidies, the aim is to \"redirect, reallocate, reform or eliminate incentives harmful for biodiversity\" on the scale of at least US $500bn per year.\nThe new Global Biodiversity Framework (GBD) is seen as the biodiversity equivalent of the Paris climate agreement. Biodiversity refers to all the different living things on Earth and how they fit together in a delicate web of life that we rely on for food, clean air and water.\nOne of the key ambitions is to turn 30% of Earth's lands and seas into protected areas by 2030. A recent UN climate report underlined the importance of conserving at least 30% of the planet to achieve biodiversity and climate goals.\nAnother goal is to ensure that, by 2050, a \"shared vision of living in harmony with nature is fulfilled\".\n\"We have this one goal, which is to bend the curve on biodiversity loss and really to build that shared future to live in harmony with nature in the long term,\" the convention's executive secretary, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, told reporters at the start of the talks.\nScientists have issued repeated warnings about threats to nature driven by human actions, including chopping down forests and turning natural land over to farming.\nA landmark 2019 assessment warned that nature was declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history, with up to one million species facing extinction.\nThe Cop15 conference in Kunming is expected to take place almost two years later than originally planned due to repeated delays caused by the Covid pandemic.\nThis has left the world without targets over the course of this decade for halting extinctions and reversing the worldwide loss of nature. \nFollow Helen  on Twitter\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EC5C/production/_123680506_treefrog_gettyimages-1169946098.jpg", "alt": "Tree frog"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9E3C/production/_123680504_seaturtle_gettyimages-1312768495.jpg", "alt": "Sea turtle"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B48B/production/_102791264_mediaitem102791260.jpg", "alt": "Indri lemur and baby (c) Russ Mittermeier"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/in-pictures-60905538", "page_details": [{"post_title": "In pictures: Behind the shop facade"}, {"post_date": "2022-03-31 23:40:14"}, {"article_body": "Maurice Dorfman ran Jeannette Fashions, a traditional haberdashery shop and the longest-surviving independent shop on Clapham High Street, south London.  \nHis death, in February last year, aged 87, brought to an end a remarkable 60 years of family trading in the heart of Clapham.\nAnd for the past 18 months, Clapham photographer Jim Grover has been piecing together Dorfman's life.\n\"More than 60 people have shared their stories, old photographs, and mementoes with me, such is the breadth and depth of affection for Maurice in the local community and the desire to help me create a fitting tribute,\" Grover says.  \n\"He was still opening his shop, every day, in his 80s.\" \nDorfman's parents came from Jewish tailoring families - and in the late 1950s, the family moved into 20-22 Clapham High Street, an enormous four-storey building, five windows wide, with two shopfronts.  \nIn the \"swinging 60s\", the first two floors were a dressmaking factory. \nDorfman delivered the dresses to London's fashion shops. \nAnd the family lived above the business.\nGrover photographed the objects and pictures he found on fabrics from Dorfman's shop.\nAnd among the many items restored especially for the exhibition is an early 1960s Kodachrome slide showing Dorfman and his mother, Jeanette, with their Harley-Davidson motorbikes.\n\"This tribute to Maurice is also a piece of social history, bringing back memories of some of the popular pleasures of the 1960s such as motorcycling rallies, ballroom dancing, camping holidays, and sailing, all of which were a big part of Maurice's life,\" Grover says. \nThe death of his mother, in 1982, made Dorfman give up his job, as a cutter in the West End, and return to run the family business, which had been turned into Jeannette Fashions. \nCatering to the needs of the numerous local seamstresses, costumiers, knitters, crocheteers and dressmakers, it thrived.\nAnd some of Dorfman's customers from the 1980s still have their dress patterns.\n\"I had every type of fabric you could want,\" he told Grover, in 2016, \"silks\u2026 satins\u2026 jacquards\u2026 wedding-dress fabrics\u2026 everything... anything.  \n\"People used to buy the patterns and then they'd buy the fabric.  \n\"I used to have to chain the pattern books to the table because people used to pinch the bloody books.\"\nIn the 60s, Dorfman's girlfriend was Margaret (pictured above, on the left), originally a dressmaker and seamstress, whom he met at a ballroom-dancing lesson in a small studio on the High Street.  \nAnd as part of this project, Grover tracked down her daughter, Anne (on the right), a successful wedding photographer, in the US.\n\"He was so kind,\" she said, \"he included me in everything. \n\"When he took her to the theatre and romantic dinners I went too - my poor mother.\"\nOne of the many dog owners who made regular visits to Dorfman's shop told Grover: \"He absolutely loved my dog and vice versa. \n\"I couldn't actually walk past the shop if I had the dog without being dragged in for a biscuit. \n\"He always had a biscuit for my dog and a sweetie for my son.\"\nFollowing the death of his father, in 1992, Dorfman lived a modest life, alone for 30 years in the enormous flat above the shop, with few of the conveniences of modern life, such as central heating.\n\"His home is a beautiful time capsule from a bygone era,\" Grover says.\nFrom the windows of his flat, Dorfman witnessed the profound changes to the High Street over six decades.  \nThe photographs above show the junction with Aristotle Road, in the 1960s and this year. \nMany contributors mentioned Dorfman's generosity and kindnesses in the local community - but reciprocal offers of help and support as he grew older were frustratingly rebuffed.\nOne customer made him a pair of fingerless mittens with the green wool that he stocked and remembers Dorfman asking what he was supposed to do with them. \nAlthough after a while, he came to admit they were \"actually pretty good\". \nTwo bouts of cancer, his advancing age and the general challenges facing independent High Street shops gradually took their toll. \nThe annual rates bill alone exceeded the shop's sales, in its final years.\nIt was no longer a commercial enterprise - but Dorfman continued to open up every day, giving purpose to his life.\nStock levels dwindled and the shop became a pale shadow of its glory years.  \n\"It was a bit run-down but it looked colourful and it looked exciting and you could go in there and you could feel comfortable,\" one of Dorfman's customers of many years said.\n\"The shop had a wonderful homemade feel to all of the various fittings,\" Grover says. \n\"I had never noticed the handmade clapper on the ceiling above his cutting room table - but someone who once worked there, back in the 1980s, told me that if the shop got busy, then Maurice would pull the cord which would bang the ceiling, summoning help from the home upstairs.\"\nAfter Dorfman died, Grover filled the shop window with portraits of him - as a tribute and to communicate his death to the community. \n\"The display of affection for this man, and the recognition of the valuable role he had fulfilled in the community for so long, made me realise that I needed to do something more,\" Grover says.\n\"And so began my 18-month journey of discovery - an immense journey I never intended or anticipated and a journey filled with surprises and discoveries. \n\"But for me, Maurice was one of life's unsung heroes who richly deserves to be celebrated and recognised.\"\nBehind the Shop Facade: The Life of Maurice Dorfman is at Clapham Library throughout April.\nGrover's other work can be seen on his website. \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/F80E/production/_123920536_01.jpg", "alt": "Maurice Dorfman in his shop"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/5FB6/production/_123920542_04.jpg", "alt": "Building in Clapham"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/17388/production/_123921159_05.jpg", "alt": "A photograph of Maurice Dorfman with his mother"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/3EF0/production/_123921161_06.jpg", "alt": "Dress patters"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/8D10/production/_123921163_07.jpg", "alt": "Dorfman's girlfriend, Anne with her daughter"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/12950/production/_123921167_09.jpg", "alt": "Maurice Dorfman and a dog in his shop"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/17B58/production/_123921179_10.jpg", "alt": "Maurice Dorfman's home"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/46C0/production/_123921181_11.jpg", "alt": "The view from Dorman's flat"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/94E0/production/_123921183_12.jpg", "alt": "Mittens"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/E300/production/_123921185_13.jpg", "alt": "Haberdashery in the shop"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/13120/production/_123921187_14.jpg", "alt": "Inside the shop"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/2BCC/production/_123921211_16.jpg", "alt": "The shop with photographs in the window"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/79EC/production/_123921213_phil17.jpg", "alt": "Needles on sale in the shop"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/C80C/production/_123921215_18.jpg", "alt": "Maurice Dorfman's tailoring shears"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-africa-60939581", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Africa's week in pictures: 25-31 March 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-01 00:51:30"}, {"article_body": "A selection of the week's best photos from across the continent and beyond:\nImages subject to copyright.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/72FB/production/_112953492__90021446_test_grey_line_new-nc.png", "alt": "Short presentational grey line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/30CF/production/_123959421_mediaitem123959420.jpg", "alt": "Maasai Kenyan women smiling as they take part in a climate strike.

07:33:48"}, {"article_body": "Some residents under lockdown in Shanghai say they are running out of food, amid the city's biggest-ever Covid outbreak.\nResidents are confined to their homes, banned from leaving for even essential reasons such as grocery shopping.\nNearly 20,000 cases were reported on Thursday in China's biggest city - another near-record high.\nOfficials have admitted the city is facing \"difficulties\" but say they are trying to improve this. \nBut public anger is also being stoked by other drastic measures - such as the removal of children from their parents if they test positive. \nShanghai officials later responded by allowing parents who were also infected to accompany their children to isolation centres. \nHowever, according to a Reuters report, there are still complaints over children separated from parents who were not Covid-positive. \nThe city began another round of mandatory mass testing on Wednesday to identify and isolate every case.\nShanghai residents who test positive can't isolate in their homes even if their conditions are mild or asymptomatic.\nThey have to go to mandatory quarantine facilities, which critics say have become crowded and have sub-par conditions. \nWhen Omicron first emerged in Shanghai a month ago, the city quarantined only certain compounds. Then as the virus spread officials last week implemented a staggered lockdown where the city was split into two and each half had separate measures.\nOn Monday the lockdown was extended indefinitely to cover the entire city of 25 million people.\nStrict rules mean most people have to order in food and water and wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs.\nBut the lockdown extension has overwhelmed delivery services, grocery shop websites and even the distribution of government supplies.\nMany delivery personnel are also in locked-down areas, leading to an overall decrease in delivery capacity. \nLocals in some areas of the city say they've been completely cut off.\n\"Please solve the problem of insufficient delivery capacity as soon as possible,\" one user wrote on social media site Weibo in response to city officials' video message.\nAnother person wrote that it was the \"first time in my life that I have gone hungry\".\nResidents have also raised other concerns about price gouging, and how elderly or less tech-savvy residents are surviving.\nCity officials acknowledged the food struggles on Wednesday, saying Shanghai had enough supplies of rice, noodles, grain, oil and meat but there were delays in distributing them.\n\"It is true there are some difficulties in ensuring the supply of daily necessities,\" said Liu Min, the deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce.\nOn Thursday, Shanghai's vice mayor added the city would try to re-open some wholesale markets and food stores, and allow more delivery personnel out of locked-down areas. \n\"We have been holding meetings overnight to try and figure out solutions,\" said Chen Tong. \nChina is one of the last remaining nations still committed to eradicating Covid, in contrast to most of the world which is trying to live with the virus in its Omicron variation.\nThe country has successfully enacted full lockdowns before - endured by millions of people in cities including Xi'an and Wuhan  - but Shanghai is its biggest city and the case spread this time is much higher than previous outbreaks.\nAs one of the economic powerhouses of China, Shanghai's shutdown is also fuelling concerns about the impact to China and the world's economy.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CC03/production/_124072225_02a56dc0-87c4-4229-8e51-58e0025b71c8.jpg", "alt": "Workers wearing protective gear sort bags of vegetables and groceries on a truck to distribute them to residents at a residential compound during lockdown in Shanghai on 5 April"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AB33/production/_124072834_gettyimages-1389453492.jpg", "alt": "Locals queue to get tested at a Covid clinic in Shanghai"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/604B/production/_97415642_007_in_numbers_624.png", "alt": "Presentational white space"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F313/production/_124072226_gettyimages-1389801607.jpg", "alt": "Workers transport supplies to a temporary warehouse at a football field in Shanghai on April 5, 2022"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-60950507", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Shanghai lockdown: Economy shaken by zero-Covid measures"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-03 23:39:26"}, {"article_body": "From Tesla's giga factory to a huge Disney resort, many multinational companies have their Chinese foothold in Shanghai. But in recent days the usually bustling financial centre has been stopped in its tracks after a spike in coronavirus cases.\nWith little notice, officials imposed a lockdown on the city's more than 26m residents. The restrictions, which started as a two-stage lockdown last week, have now been expanded to confine practically all residents to their homes.\nThe latest round of quarantining is China's largest since the coronavirus outbreak was first identified in Wuhan at the end of 2019.  \nThis lockdown could turn out to be particularly costly for the world's second largest economy. \nAs well as being a major focus of the financial industry, Shanghai is a hub for semiconductor, electronics and car manufacturing. It is also the world's busiest shipping port.\nXu Tianchen, China economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit said short-term supply chain disruptions will have an impact on China's economy as a whole.    \n\"There will also be ripple effects elsewhere because of the interconnectedness between Shanghai and other regions of China, especially the manufacturing hub of the Yangtze River Delta,\" he said.\nOn a more local level, the city known for its high-end storefronts like Gucci and Louis Vuitton has already seen consumer spending slump. \nLost business at retailers, hotels, and restaurants could directly cost Shanghai 3.7% of its annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to Mr Xu.\nGDP is a key measure of the health, or otherwise, of an economy.\nThe Chinese government has set a target for the country's GDP to grow by 5.5% this year. But some analysts have said it will struggle to meet that goal.\nAt the end of last week, data pointed to a slowdown in March for China's manufacturing and services sectors.\nIt came after the technology hub Shenzhen and Jilin in China's industrial north-east last month also faced lockdowns so that officials could conduct mass coronavirus testing and try to curb the spread of the highly transmissible Omnicron variant of Covid-19.\n\"We have seen PMI data, which shows that both manufacturing and services sectors are actually hit hard. And that has not included the Shanghai lockdown. So I think qualitatively we're seeing more downside pressure for the first and second quarters of GDP data,\" according to Peiqian Liu, China economist for NatWest Markets.\nPMI data is a summary of market conditions gathered through surveying senior executives in key industries about their expectations for a number of factors including new orders, production and employment.\nWith the number of coronavirus cases rising, there could also be more trouble ahead if there are further lockdowns, especially for small business owners.  \n\"The focus is much more on how employment is going to hold up in a prolonged lockdown or extended period of uncertainties of lockdown due to outbreaks.\n\"So I think the service sector is not only facing a short-term pressure from a three-week lockdown from Shenzhen or a one-week lockdown from Shanghai, but facing much more pressure from the uncertainty that's going down the road with current set of Covid management policies,\" Ms Liu said.\nWhile some companies in Shanghai have decided to close during the lockdown, others in industries like financial services and car manufacturing have implemented so-called \"closed-loop\" systems, according to Ms Liu.\nEssentially, this means that employees have to live as well as work at their offices or factories.\n\"Imagine what happened in the Winter Olympics. It was also a closed-loop management, just to ensure that things within the bubble works operationally normal, and that they isolate people from outside or from the rest of China.\"\nHowever, Mr Xu points out that it is not a strategy that can be sustained in the long-term.\n\"There's a concern that if lockdowns become prolonged and disruptions to the transportation to the supply chain persist, businesses will be unable to source supplies. \n\"So they are having an impact on road transport. The obvious risk is that Shanghai fails to eliminate the current outbreak quickly,\" he said.\nEven as much of the rest of the world opens borders and eases restrictions, China still looks unlikely to shift away from its strict approach to the coronavirus.\n\"The policy has been a political source of legitimacy. The low levels of infections and deaths in China are often compared to other countries in the domestic media. As a result, the majority of the population within China still favour the zero-Covid policy, despite the increasing economic costs,\" Mr Xu said.\nBut Ms Liu believes there is a possible silver lining as Beijing has pledged to support the economy to meet its ambitious growth target. \n\"The government has been responsive with a set of easing policies from both fiscal and monetary front.\n\"That will hopefully stabilise the domestic growth momentum for this for the time being, and to ensure China's smooth running of the supply chain to minimise the global interruption of supply chain at this short term,\" she said.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/94DB/production/_123970183_gettyimages-1239637948.jpg", "alt": "A man stands behind barriers during lockdown as a measure against the Covid-19 coronavirus in Shanghai."}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/604B/production/_97415642_007_in_numbers_624.png", "alt": "Presentational white space"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60961420", "page_details": [{"post_title": "US to end policy expelling migrants over Covid"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-01 18:40:52"}, {"article_body": "The US will halt a pandemic policy that allowed migrants to be swiftly expelled over concerns about spreading Covid-19.\nThe policy known as Title 42 will end on 23 May after more than two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday.\nAimed at stopping virus spread in migrant holding facilities, the Trump policy was twice extended by President Joe Biden.\nOver 1.7 million people have been expelled under the policy.\nMr Biden had been under pressure from his party to end the controversial order, with critics arguing that its public health benefits failed to outweigh harm to the rights of migrants.\nEnacted by former President Trump in March 2020, it allows US authorities to expel migrants seeking asylum without being given the chance to put forward their case. Children and some families are exempt.\nThough Mr Biden had pledged to reverse Trump-era immigration policies while in office, the CDC under his administration extended Title 42 in August 2021, and again in January, due to the delta and omicron variants, respectively. \nOn Friday, the CDC said that it was ready to rescind the policy given the current, more favourable public health outlook and after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\"After considering current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight Covid-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics), the CDC Director has determined that an Order suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary,\" it said.\nImmigration rights advocates applauded the move. Friday's announcement marked a \"momentous day for immigrant rights activists, immigrants, and refugees everywhere,\" Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said, while Murad Awawdeh of New York Immigration Coalition called it a \"long-overdue\" step.\nHowever, Republicans - and some Democrats - warned that repealing Title 42 could lead to a surge in migrants at the US-Mexico border. \nJames Comer, a Republican Kentucky congressman, called the move \"reckless\" and Democratic senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema, from the border state of Arizona, said they were sceptical that a plan was in place to address migrant applications at the border.\nThe DHS director said Friday his agency had a strategy to \"manage any potential increase in the number of migrants encountered at our border\".\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3D66/production/_123981751_mediaitem123981750.jpg", "alt": "Family embraces at border"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-60708123", "page_details": [{"post_title": "'I've had long Covid for two years now'"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-01 23:57:14"}, {"article_body": "The initial emergency of Covid may feel like it's over, but thousands of people are still suffering from ongoing symptoms known as long Covid. So are we any closer to understanding the causes of this debilitating condition or to finding the best way of treating it?\nNeil Robinson is finding it hard to accept that he is still affected by Covid. \"I was just so certain that I would have recovered by now,\" he told me. \nJo House is learning to adjust to her new reality. \"It feels weird to say it, but I'm now disabled and I need to rethink how I live my life,\" she says. \nAnd although John Dusabe Richards is now improving, he has not fully recovered. A year after a mild Covid infection he could not read a bedtime book to his children because of the \"sandbag on my chest\" that made it hard to breathe. The breathlessness, constant headaches and joint pain are largely gone, but his fatigue is lingering. Dancing or doing sports with his kids needs planning due to an unnaturally long recovery time.  \n\"Every time I think that I'm close to recovery, I push too far and then relapse and it is bad. I have to remain within the limits of what I can do,\" he says. \nThis pattern will be familiar to many with long Covid. The core experience of long Covid revolves around the unholy trinity of fatigue, brain fog and muscle pain. But there is a long list of rarer symptoms covering almost every bodily function ranging from digestive problems to night sweats and depression to hair loss. \nThe Office for National Statistics says one in 40 people have symptoms that last at least three months after an infection. Around 1.5 million people in the UK say they have long Covid symptoms with growing numbers (685,000) saying their long Covid has lasted longer than a year. \n\"This is a picture that we're seeing more and more,\" Dr David Strain, from the NHS long Covid taskforce and the University of Exeter, told me. \nIt seems remarkable that a viral infection, even one that was brief and mild, can lead to debilitating symptoms that, for some people, can last for years. \nThere is no single unifying cause of all long Covid, but scientists are focusing on four main areas:  \nMicro-clots: Some symptoms of long Covid could be down to tiny clots blocking up the smallest blood vessels in our bodies, called capillaries. Our major arteries and veins are like motorways up and down our body, but capillaries do the actual job of getting oxygen and nutrients to the individual cells of our bodies. Crucially, capillaries also clear away the waste products of our metabolism. Blocked capillaries could lead to cells becoming rapidly distressed.\n\"That would account for why some people start the day feeling great because the body's had time to replenish itself, but very, very quickly, they become exhausted,\" says Dr Strain.\nIt could also account for fatigue that lasts for days after strenuous activity as \"those toxins build up and they're just not clearing at the normal rate,\" he says.\nResearch has also shown the brain can shrink by between 0.2% and 2% even after mild infection so unrepaired damage is a potential cause of symptoms like brain fog.\nImmune system:  Scientists have also reported changes in the immune system of people with long Covid. Inflammation is part of the body's normal response to infection or injury, but proteins in the blood suggest excessive inflammation in long Covid which could be driving some symptoms. \nMeanwhile, antibodies that normally attack foreign invaders have been shown to stick to the body's own cells in long Covid. Autoantibodies are antibodies that mistakenly target and react with a person's own tissues or organs. These could cause different symptoms depending on where they bind, explains Prof Chris Brightling, from the University of Leicester: \"Those with muscle pain and weakness might have an autoimmune problem related to muscles, those with an affected heart rhythm might have autoantibodies to the heart tissue.\"\nPersistent infection: There is also debate about whether the virus is fully kicked out of the body in some with long Covid. The infection starts in the lungs and airways, but the virus is able to infect other parts of the body too. The idea is that the virus takes up residence elsewhere in the body, most likely in the gut which is already teeming with microbial life. \n\"It is just leaking enough virus into the blood that every so often you are back to the beginning again, you are experiencing that flu-like illness and you are exhausted for no apparent reason,\" says Dr Strain. \nMitochondrial damage: Another concept centres around the body's ability to harness energy, possibly due to abnormalities in the mitochondria. Mitochondria, which are in nearly every cell of our body, are like minute power stations that convert the energy from food into a form usable by the body. \n\"There are people suggesting that the virus itself makes those mitochondria go dormant, which is why we run out of energy much quicker in the fatigue and in the brain fog,\" says Dr Strain.\nLong Covid clinics have been set up, but there are no proven cures for the condition. \nNeil says his \"biggest problem\" is fatigue and that when he developed brain fog and confusion it reminded him of when his grandfather first got dementia, as the symptoms were \"almost identical\". \nNeil started going to a clinic a year ago and was given breathing exercises and his activity and energy levels were monitored. But recent physical and mental tests found that he was \"no better\", which leaves him in limbo. \"I can't be discharged, but they don't currently have anything else to offer,\" he says. \nBut understanding the range of possible causes of long Covid is giving new ideas for therapies. \nHigh levels of inflammation mean there is a good argument that antihistamines may become very important, says Prof Brightling, as the drugs could calm the immune response down in the same way they do in allergies. \nBlood-thinning drugs that make it harder for clots to form are being investigated and even drugs that boost mitochondria function are being trialled.\nMeanwhile, if long Covid is caused by a persistent infection it raises the prospect of antivirals, vaccines or lab-made antibodies being useful. \nProf Brightling says healthier lifestyles may help some people as the severity of long Covid has been linked to obesity and other health conditions. \nDr Strain says some people need to be careful about trying to exercise their way out of long Covid. He says it has worked for some, but many will find it makes their condition worse. \"It takes much longer to recover from exercise than the benefit you get... it's one step forward, two steps back.\" \nHe recommends finding the brain and body's limit before exhaustion sets in and then going no further than 80% of that limit before taking a rest. \"For some people that could be walking a mile, for others it could just be standing up for 10 minutes to peel the carrots,\" he says. \nHowever, that is easier said than done. Jo House has gone from working full time to just one day and even that is spread over the week. The usual family structure has been flipped on its head with her \"amazing boys\" taking on the role of carer. \n\"Every once in a while I want to try and have some fun and do something normal like socialise with my friends or take the dog for a walk,\" she says. \n\"What happens is I collapse back into bed. It feels like I've run a marathon and I've ended up in A&E a couple of times. So I think actually my problem is I am not good enough yet at pacing and resting.\"\nIt is impossible to know what the long term prognosis of people with long Covid is, however, there are strong parallels with another condition - chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). The cause has not been proven, although infections are a leading candidate, and it has been notoriously difficult to treat.  \nDr Strain says \"in all likelihood, ME and long Covid are the same family of conditions with a different underlying trigger\" and many with ME/CFS \"are left with symptoms from that for years, if not decades afterwards\".  \nProf Brightling warns that although society is moving on from the pandemic, there are still large numbers of coronavirus infections and there is still a need to understand the long term implications of being infected and how to treat long Covid. \n\"There is a real risk of a pretty awful legacy, there is a real chance to get it right, but also a real chance to get it very wrong,\" he says.\nFollow James on Twitter \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6ADE/production/_123885372_neilheadshot1.jpg", "alt": "Neil Robinson"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E766/production/_123883295_img_1563.jpg", "alt": "John Dusabe Richards"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/91EE/production/_123885373_johouse.jpg", "alt": "Jo House"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-60950929", "page_details": [{"post_title": "China: Shanghai hospital struggles with Covid infections"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-02 00:45:53"}, {"article_body": "Authorities in Shanghai are struggling to deal with a suspected wave of Covid infections at a large hospital for the elderly, in a sign of how serious the outbreak is in China's biggest city.\nShanghai has not declared any new Covid deaths in the city since the outbreak of the latest wave of the virus. \nBut the BBC has spoken to people working at the Donghai Elderly Care Hospital in the city's eastern Pudong area who have described a dire situation and desperate attempts to help dozens of elderly patients, some of whom have died. \nA nurse told the BBC that the first positive cases were discovered at the facility - one of the biggest of its kind in Shanghai - three weeks ago. \nSince then it has been sealed off, and specialist teams from the municipal centre for disease control have been trying to contain the spread.\nAnother care worker who was drafted in to work at the hospital last week told us she had seen one patient die, and heard of a colleague who had dealt with another dead patient. \nBut workers say that it is hard to tell if the victims had died from Covid as there have been many infections.\nThe nurse told the BBC that she was working and sleeping at the hospital before being moved to a quarantine facility. Since then she said a colleague had told her the situation had gotten \"worse and worse\" with new cases \"every day\". \nShe claimed that both medical staff and experts sent in by the Shanghai government were also infected, saying hundreds of people there had caught Covid.\nShe told the BBC: \"At first, we just kept working as usual, but later they started to block each department and the manager told us the real situation was much worse.\"\nShe said there were patients who were refusing to wear masks.\nA care worker who has been working at the hospital this week told the BBC that \"sanitary conditions were pretty bad\" when she arrived. \nVideos taken from within the facility and sent to the BBC appear to show overflowing bins and full bags of rubbish strewn in hallways in at least one part of the home.\nMeanwhile on social media, there have been multiple complaints from people who said they were unable to contact their loved ones in the facility.\nOne man who told the BBC his grandmother is at the hospital said it was very difficult to get information on her condition. A care worker whom he spoke to initially was unable to help further after they tested positive and were quarantined.\nHe says he has not been able to speak to his grandmother on the phone since shortly after the lockdown began on Monday. Staff who picked up when he called were unable to give any details about what she was being given to eat, or any medication administered, he said.\nThe BBC has tried to contact Donghai Hospital, Pudong New District Health Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Commission for comment, but none responded to our calls.\nA nearby funeral home, contacted by the BBC, was unable to say if it had or had not received any dead patients from the hospital. The Shanghai Foreign Affairs office was also approached for a comment, but did not respond.\nBut in repeated public statements the authorities have confirmed cases citing the address of the hospital, though they did not specifically name it. The address has been mentioned nine times in official case reports in the last two weeks.\nThere's evidence elsewhere that Shanghai's health care system is struggling to deal with some of the increased demands put on it.\nOn Thursday health officials offered a formal apology to the family of a 62-year-old man who died after he was refused further emergency treatment for an asthma attack. An ambulance medic who refused to transport the patient or offer the use of an AED has been suspended.\nShanghai is China's biggest city with a population of almost 25 million. It's half-way through a nine-day citywide lockdown to try to stop the spread of a resurgent virus.\nOfficials had planned to shut the eastern half of the city and test everyone living there, then impose the same lockdown on the western side of the city. \nDespite plans to open up Pudong on Friday, there are stringent measures still in place and delayed test results which mean many areas, and millions of people, remain locked down.\nA week before the lockdown was imposed other officials had claimed that Shanghai was too big and too important to China's economy to be locked down in the way that other cities like Wuhan, Xi'an and Shenzhen had been.\nBut now a senior Communist Party official has admitted Shanghai had not been prepared for the outbreak. Ma Chunlei said yesterday that \"our awareness was insufficient... our preparation is not sufficient\". \nIn a rare public admission of failings he added: \"We sincerely accept your criticism and we are working hard to improve.\"\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8B5B/production/_123957653_donghai7.jpg", "alt": "Picture of Donghai Elderly Care Hospital in Shanghai"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/469/cpsprodpb/A043/production/_123972014_donghai3.jpg", "alt": "Filled rubbish bags in Donghai"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png", "alt": "1px transparent line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/489/cpsprodpb/15FAB/production/_123972009_donghai.jpg", "alt": "Overflowing bins at Donghai"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png", "alt": "1px transparent line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-61025572", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Report into Immensa lab Covid errors must be published- MP"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 17:05:28"}, {"article_body": "The Shadow Minister for Public Health has called on the Health Security Agency to publish a report into serious errors at a Covid-19 lab.\nThe Immensa Health Clinic in Wolverhampton issued an estimated 43,000 false negative results to people across the south west.\nAndrew Gwynne MP said the HSA had \"very serious questions to answer\" and people needed to know what had gone wrong.\nThe HSA has said a \"full investigation remains ongoing\".\nImmensa and its parent company Dante Labs has declined a BBC request for comment. \nConcerns were raised in autumn when people received positive results from their lateral flow tests, followed by negative results in subsequent PCR tests issued by the lab between 8 September and 12 October.\nIt led to people who had Covid-19 being incorrectly informed they were negative and did not need to isolate.\nThe BBC understands a preliminary report into what went wrong was completed before Christmas, but remains unpublished.\nMr Gwynne said the big question was how the errors could have been allowed to continue for several weeks without any external checks.\n\"You would hope that all these laboratories were routinely tested, and that due diligence was done on the results, so that people did have confidence the results were perfect and not sending people into the community and spreading the coronavirus to all and sundry.\n\"The suspicion in me is that there is possibly information that they don't want to be routinely in the public domain, but transparency is required here. \n\"We need to know what went wrong,\" he said.\nProfessor of economics at the University of Warwick, Thiemo Fetzer, said he had been unsuccessful in applying to see the data using freedom of information requests.\nHe said he did not understand why it was taking so long to publish answers into what went wrong.\n\"The data is there so one would hope there is the will to carry this out, but so far we haven't been particularly lucky in securing access to this data,\" he said.\nIn a statement, the UK Health Security Agency said: \"A full investigation remains ongoing and we will provide an update in due course; we cannot comment on any information that could form part of these investigations before they are complete.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

at risk at the Glasgow Lighthouse Lab after the UK government ended its testing contract with the centre at the end of March.\nThe lab was set up by the University of Glasgow on behalf of the UK government. \nIt has conducted 26 million PCR tests from across the UK since April 2020.\nThe Scottish government said it was working with the university to \"enable it to support all staff involved\".\nThe Glasgow facility is among a number of laboratories to be dropped from the national testing network, as part of the UK government's living with Covid plan.\nThe decision to end the contract was made by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which provided funding as part of the national response to the pandemic.\nIt said on Friday that discussions remained ongoing \"around the role that the laboratory will play as part of network resilience and contingency capacity\".\nLast week, the University of Glasgow launched a formal 45-day consultation period on redundancies with Unite, as a result of the lack of funding and pending contracts.  \nUnite, which represents sample handlers and lab technicians at the site in Glasgow, said if no resolution could be found, some staff contracts could be terminated as early as 14 May.\nUnite industrial officer Alison Maclean said: \"There has been no commitment from the Scottish government to extend the funding or redeploy this critically- important workforce. \n\"Covid numbers, hospitalisation and deaths have increased in Scotland, and notwithstanding the future impact of Covid variants, this grave uncertainty for 745 workers is bewildering and dangerous.\n\"Unite is demanding that the Scottish government urgently review the decision to wind down testing in the interests of public health, and immediately move to ensure that the skilled workforce at the Lighthouse Lab are supported.\"\nA spokeswoman for the University of Glasgow said: \"Following UKHSA's decision to end the Lighthouse Lab's contract, we are in active discussions with the UK Health Security Agency, Scottish government and trade unions to discuss the future requirements of the lab.\"\nA Scottish government spokeswoman said the Glasgow centre had been a \"high performing lab\" throughout the Covid-19 response.\nShe said: \"We are in close contact with the university and are aware of its consultation with staff and trade unions on potential job losses relating to the cessation of UK government-held testing contracts, and are disappointed that the UK Health Security Agency has not been able to provide further clarity on future activity.\n\"The Scottish government is working with the university to enable it to support all staff involved to find, where necessary, alternative employment opportunities either with their existing employer or with another employer or sector. \n\"We are actively engaging with trade unions to ensure whatever approach is taken in future has the workforce at the heart of those discussions.\"\nA UKHSA spokeswoman said that with free testing now focused on protecting specific groups, there would be a significant drop in laboratory demand. \nShe said: \"In response, UKHSA has consolidated the Lighthouse Laboratory network to deliver maximum efficiency and value for money. \n\"This has included reducing the capacity at the Glasgow laboratory effective from 1 April, but discussions remain ongoing around the role that the laboratory will play as part of network resilience and contingency capacity. \n\"We would like to thank all the Glasgow Lighthouse Laboratory staff who have

However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths. \nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again in the autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000.  During the latest surge in cases, they have returned to and surpassed that level. \nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days. \nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak. \nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4193/production/_124078761_bbcpostcardpress.jpg", "alt": "Graphic - 7 April"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/98E7/production/_110134193_7c0cb0e3-4737-486c-a1da-3a40b0eb8147.gif", "alt": "Presentational grey line 1"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8FB3/production/_124078763_cca00bf5-6ba5-487a-9e1d-5617784c9bfa.png", "alt": "Cases - 7 April"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1303F/production/_124078877_e75869e3-118a-4279-9d8a-10b2fce49d72.png", "alt": "Recent cases - 7 April"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/EFEA/production/_124081416_f87cfb28-6134-4bcd-9560-6bd713ce0004.png", "alt": "Local authority rates - 7 April"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/17A13/production/_124078769_1719e334-e9f8-452c-b71c-2ae4ab001058.png", "alt": "Deaths - 7 April"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/914D/production/_124079173_a56f103f-a168-43e1-be7f-5ca31783038d-1.png", "alt": "Scotland's Covid deaths over the whole pandemic.

Oleg will help!\" he shouted to his daughter.\nBut the reply came from one of the Russian soldiers, he said.  \n\"Oleg will not help you any more.\" \nThey found Oleg on the pavement outside the gate, and it was clear from the way he was lying that he had been forced to kneel and shot in the head at point blank range, Iryna said. He was a welder who lived a quiet life on the corner of Yablonska Street in Bucha, who was taken out of his home and killed.\nThe killing is one of scores - if not hundreds - being uncovered in Bucha after Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv suburb recently. The mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed. There is no official tally yet.  \nRussia has denied any involvement in the atrocities. But its burned-out tanks litter the city. On the grounds of a church, there is an open mass grave with the dead still inside, some in black body bags, some loose in the sand. On the roads, there are bullet-riddled civilian cars - at least one with a body still inside. Houses are caved in by shelling, their driveways ploughed over by tanks. Residents have described Russian soldiers shooting civilians outside their homes with no provocation, and satellite imagery shows that bodies were lying in the streets while the Russians were still in control.\nThe Russian soldiers who killed Oleg Abramov \"did not ask him anything\", his wife Iryna said. \n\"They didn't ask anything or say anything, they just killed him,\" she said. \"They only told him to take off his shirt, kneel down, and they shot him.\" \nShe wept on Tuesday as she stood on the spot where he was killed, where a dark patch of blood was still visible on the street. When she ran out and found his disfigured body, the four Russian soldiers who dragged him out were standing casually drinking water, she said. She screamed at them to shoot her, and one raised his gun, then lowered it, then raised it again, and lowered it, until Volodymyr dragged her back inside the gate.  \n\"Those soldiers told us we had three minutes to leave and they forced us to run in our slippers,\" Volodymyr said. \"Bucha was like an apocalypse - dead bodies everywhere, the streets full of smoke.\"\nVolodymyr and Iryna had no choice but to leave Oleg's body lying on the street and it lay there for nearly a month while they sheltered at a relative's house nearby. When it was safe to return, Volodymyr tried to bury his son-in-law on a rough patch of earth by the pavement, and the half-dug hole was still visible there on Tuesday. \nBut exhausted by the effort, and afraid of Russian soldiers, Volodymyr carried Oleg back inside the yard and laid him there. Later, Ukrainian soldiers loaded the body into a van, Volodymyr said, and took it away. \"I have no idea how we are going to find it now,\" he said.\nUkrainian authorities have now cleared the bodies off the streets of Bucha but there are fears more will be found in the basements and yards of private homes. Officials have only just begun the process of cataloguing the horrors. And so great is the damage in Bucha, it is hard to imagine the scale of the reconstruction needed to restore it to the attractive suburb it once was. \nAlong one road through the town on Tuesday, where burned-out tanks were piled up and almost every house was destroyed, 84-year-old Hryhoriy Zamohylnyi was sweeping the street, as if oblivious to the total destruction around him. Somehow, his home was intact - the only building left undamaged along the whole stretch of road.  \n\"I saw the war with the Germans and now this war with the Russians,\" said Zamohylnyi, a former engineer, born and raised in Bucha. \"What you see here is animal cruelty,\" he said. \nAddressing the UN security council on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the Russians of committing the worst crimes since World War Two, and called for those responsible to be tried as the Nazis were in Nuremberg.  \n\"The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,\" he said. \"They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.\"\nUkraine has begun a war crimes investigation into Russia's actions in Bucha and nearby Irpin. It says 410 bodies have been found across the two suburbs so far.  \nThere are fears now that more atrocities will be found as the Russians retreat further and more suburbs are opened up - more bodies in the streets, more mass graves. Volodymyr and Iryna Abramov are only looking for one body, and their fear is that they will never find it. \n\"He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,\" Volodymyr said.  \n\"Just before he died, while I was in the yard, I saw him briefly through the open gate, on his knees, and he said his final words. He asked them why.\"\nRodion Miroshynk and Daria Sipigina contributed to this report.

He says there is evidence of killings, carried out in Bucha and other places, of people based on their Ukrainian identity.\n\"It's not just killing people, it's targeting a national identity group,\" he says. \nHowever, it's the rhetoric coming from Moscow that tips over into genocidal intent, Mr Finkel says. \nHe points to an article titled \"What should Russia do with Ukraine?\" published this week by Russia's state-owned media Ria news agency.\nThe article argues that Ukraine \"is impossible as a nation state\" and even its name \"apparently cannot be retained\"; the Ukrainian nationalist elite \"need to be liquidated, its re-education is impossible\", argues the writer, Timofei Sergeytsev.\nHe bases his theory on the baseless claim that Ukraine is a Nazi state, arguing that a significant section of the population is guilty too because they are \"passive Nazis\", and therefore accomplices. After a Russian victory these people would require re-education lasting at least a generation and it would \"inevitably mean de-Ukrainisation\".\n\"For me, the shift in tone in recent weeks in Russia, and especially among the elites, was the tipping point that we call the threshold of intent, not just to destroy the state... but to destroy an identity,\" says Prof Finkel.\n\"The goal of the war is de-Ukrainisation... they are not focusing on the state, they're focusing on Ukrainians.\"\nGregory Stanton, founding president and chair of Genocide Watch, says there is proof \"that the Russian army is in fact intending to destroy, in part, the Ukrainian national group\".\n\"That's why they're targeting civilians. They're not just targeting combatants and military.\"\nHe says President Putin's claims in the lead-up to the invasion, that the eight-year war in Ukraine's east looked like genocide, were what some scholars call \"mirroring\". \n\"Often the perpetrator of genocide will accuse the other side - the targeted victims - of intending to commit genocide before, in fact, the perpetrator does so. That's what happened in this case.\"\nBut other experts in the field of genocide say it's too early to define Russian atrocities in that category.\nAccording to Jonathan Leader Maynard, lecturer in international politics at King's College London, the evidence is still too unclear under the strict wording of the Genocide Convention.\nThat doesn't necessarily mean genocide is not taking place - he says it's \"very clear\" that atrocities are happening - just that the bar has yet to be cleared. \n\"It's possible that those atrocities could be genocidal or could escalate in future to genocide, but the evidence is not strong enough yet,\" he says. \nHowever, he points to the \"deeply troubling\" rhetoric of Russia's president denying Ukraine's historical existence as an independent nation. It illustrates a \"genocidal way of thinking\", he says, where Vladimir Putin believes Ukraine \"isn't real, so they don't have the right to exist\".\nThe risk of genocide is increasing due to that kind of talk, he says, \"but we cannot automatically assume that such rhetoric is going to lead to actions carried out on the ground\".\nFor Philippe Sands, there appears to be evidence of war crimes given the targeting of civilians and the siege of the port city of Mariupol appears to be a crime against humanity.\nHowever, Prof Sands who is director of the Centre for International Courts and Tribunals at University College London, says in order to prove genocide under international law, a prosecutor must establish an intent to destroy a group, in whole or in part. And international courts have set a very high threshold for proving that.\nIntent can be established by direct evidence where the perpetrators say they are killing people in order to destroy the group. But Prof Sands believes that is unlikely to exist in Ukraine's case.\nIntent can also be inferred from a pattern of behaviour, \"but that's a tough call\", he adds. Not enough is known yet of the intentions of those Russians alleged to have carried out atrocities. \n\"Going into a village and executing a significant proportion of adult males from one national or religious group on an apparently systematic basis - if that is what happened in Bucha - could be an indicator of a genocidal intent,\" he says.\n\"But at this stage we have insufficient evidence to know what precisely happened and why. I think it's right to be extremely alert to signs of genocidal intent, as the war moves to the east of Ukraine and becomes increasingly brutal.\"\nAlex Hinton, director of the Centre for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University, says that war crimes and crimes against humanity certainly seem to be taking place in Ukraine through obliteration bombing and targeting of civilians.\nPresident Putin is displaying genocidal rhetoric, Mr Hinton says, but this will need to be clearly linked to atrocities on the ground to prove genocidal intent.\n\"I wouldn't say this is genocide like [President] Zelensky has stated, but I'd say the warning signals are there. The risk threat is very high,\" he says. \nWhether or not Russia is committing genocide should not cloud what Alex Hinton sees as clear atrocities being committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\"We know atrocity crimes are taking place and that compels action. It shouldn't be a case where we think it has to be genocide to do more.\"\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F5ED/production/_124075926_f7365ee0-1257-4128-b20f-5e778d6c1927.jpg", "alt": "Zelensky in Bucha"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/164B/production/_124070750_mediaitem124070749.jpg", "alt": "A funeral service employee sits next to bodies of civilians in Bucha"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11CFD/production/_124075927_034c83a2-b42e-4122-a608-d58ec7d9a138.jpg", "alt": "Putin in 2018"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-61002623", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Ukraine war: Destruction in the Ukrainian town of Borodyanka"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-06 05:23:33"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-60938544", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Donbas: Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 09:57:58"}, {"article_body": "Russia has pulled troops away from Kyiv and shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, after a series of defeats near the capital. This push into the area known as Donbas could mean a protracted conflict.\nWhat would Vladimir Putin need before he could claim his goal of \"liberating\" Ukraine's old industrial heart and is that possible? \nRussian forces have already triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the east, reducing Mariupol to ruins, but they have failed to inflict defeat on Ukraine's military. \nPreparing for a reinvigorated Russian onslaught on the east, President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed: \"We will fight for every metre of our land.\"\nUkraine's best-trained forces were already posted in the east because of an eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists. They are thought to have suffered heavy losses, but are still a significant challenge to Russia's invading army.\nWhen President Putin talks of Donbas, he is referring to Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. What he really means is the entirety of two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border.\nNato also expects Russian forces to try to create a land bridge, running along the south coast west of Donetsk to Crimea.\n\"The key is that it has been identified by the Kremlin as a Russian-speaking part of Ukraine that is more Russia than Ukraine,\" says Sam Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute. \nThese areas may be broadly Russian-speaking, but they are no longer pro-Russian. \"Mariupol was one of the most pro-Russian cities in Ukraine and to level it is beyond my comprehension,\" says defence specialist Konrad Muzyka, head of Rochan Consulting.\nA month into the war, Russia claimed to have taken control of 93% of Luhansk region and 54% of Donetsk. Russia's president is still a long way from subduing the entire area, but even if he were to be able to claim victory, this is a very large territory to control.\nThe Russian leader has repeatedly made the unfounded accusation that Ukraine has carried out genocide in the east. \nWhen the war began, two-thirds of the eastern regions were in Ukrainian hands. The rest was run by separatists, who created Russian-backed statelets during a war that began eight years ago. \nJust before the war, President Putin recognised the entirety of the two eastern regions as independent of Ukraine. \nIf Russia were to conquer both big regions, it would give Vladimir Putin some sort of achievement from Russia's war. The next step would then be to annexe Donbas, just like he did with Crimea after a discredited referendum in 2014. \nAnd if it came before 9 May, he would even be able to display on Victory Day, when Russia's military still celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.\nThe Russian puppet leader in Luhansk has already spoken of having a referendum in the \"near future\", although the idea of even a sham vote in a war zone seems absurd.\nRussian forces are trying to encircle Ukraine's army in the east, moving in from the north, east and south. \"This is a big territory to control, and I think we shouldn't underestimate the geographical complexities of this,\" says Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King's College London.\nAfter weeks of fighting, they failed to capture Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv south of the Russian border, but eventually seized control of Izyum - a strategic town further down the main motorway heading into the separatist-controlled east. \n\"If you look at what they're doing around Izyum, it's following the main lines of the highways and that would make sense, given that they're moving most of their equipment by road and rail,\" says Prof German.\nThe towns now in Russian sights have already experienced years of war since Russian-backed separatists first seized large parts of Donbas.\nThe next big target down the M03 road is Slovyansk, a city of 125,000 people that was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014 before being recaptured. \nThe US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says if Ukraine holds on to Slovyansk, Russia's campaign to seize both regions \"will likely fail\".\nRussian forces are bombarding a succession of towns further to the east in areas of Luhansk still under Ukrainian control, including Rubizhne, Lysychansk, Popasna and Severodonetsk. Blocks of flats have been destroyed and civilians killed in their homes. \nThese towns are important because controlling them would enable Russia to drive west and link up with Russian forces planning to move south-east of Izyum, says the ISW.\nNot only are the Russians trying to control the supply lines by road, they are also trying to block Ukrainian access to rail routes from the west. Rail is the most effective transport for Ukrainian troops and heavy weaponry and it is the fastest route out for fleeing civilians.\nControlling parts of the rail network would also enable Russian forces to move their troops and supplies.\nCivilians are being moved out ahead of the Russian advance. \"Save yourself and your family while you still can,\" local leader Serhiy Haidai appealed to residents as buses and trains headed west. Getting buses through to evacuate Rubizhne and Popasna was becoming increasingly difficult, he said.\nTrains were still running from Slovyansk on Thursday, but lines have been cut to Izyum in the north and to Mariupol and Melitopol in the south. \nMaryna Agafonova, 27, fled her family's home in Lysychansk, leaving her parents behind as Russian shells continued to fall. \"They attacked hospitals and residential buildings. There is no heating and no electricity.\"\nUkrainian forces were still holding out there in numbers, she told the BBC: \"They aren't letting the Russians occupy it.\"\nLife under the control of Russian-backed separatists is quieter, although separatist authorities have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling residential buildings and killing civilians. Officials in the Donetsk statelet say 72 civilians have died since mid-February.\nOne woman in Luhansk told the BBC on condition of anonymity that she had seen a lot of Russian military armour in the city and the atmosphere now was one of fear and caution.\n\"I'm scared - it's just scary,\" she said. Men of military age were required to join the local militia, so anyone who avoided the draft was in hiding, she explained.\n\"They're mobilising [men] on the streets, catching them. There are no men in the shops, in town, on the streets.\" As a result, all male-dominated businesses are shut, she said.\n\"We're already Russia, although just informally. Everyone has a Russian passport.\"\nAt the start of the war, the 10 brigades that made up the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) in the east were regarded as the best-equipped and best-trained soldiers that Ukraine has. \n\"We don't really know the strength of Ukrainian forces now,\" said Sam Cranny-Evans of Rusi, who believes their numbers will have been boosted by volunteers in recent weeks.\nRussian forces have already sustained high losses after more than five weeks of conflict and morale is thought to be low. They are made up of men enlisted from the local separatist areas as well as the broader Russian army.\n\"The main goal for the Ukrainians is to inflict as big losses on the Russian side as possible and the Ukrainians are using asymmetric tactics to avoid big battles,\" says Konrad Muzyka.\nOne man called Mykyta who managed to flee the Russian bombardment of Mariupol said he was confident the Ukrainian army would succeed in fighting back.\n\"Some day they will return our cities, the Azov battalion will not surrender Mariupol,\" he told the BBC. \"The Ukrainian army is very cunning, I didn't see them in my city, but I heard them, they are very good at disguise.\"\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1213/production/_123972640_volno.jpg", "alt": "Russian soldiers are seen on a tank in Volnovakha district in the pro-Russian separatists-controlled Donetsk, in Ukraine on March 26, 2022"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9213/production/_123959373_ukraine_rebel_held_areas_30march_640x2-nc.png", "alt": "Donbas map"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png", "alt": "1px transparent line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/953E/production/_124060283_ukraine_invasion_east_map__640x2-nc.png", "alt": "Map showing the Russian military advance into Ukraine from the east"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png", "alt": "1px transparent line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12E53/production/_123959377_severo.jpg", "alt": "More than 200 people were evacuated from Severodonetsk on Thursday"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/117BD/production/_124031617_kramatorsk.jpg", "alt": "Children wave from a train at Kramatorsk central station as families flee the eastern city of Kramatorsk, in the Donbass region on April 4, 2022"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-61029938", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Ukraine round-up: Villagers forced to live with the dead for days"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 21:00:20"}, {"article_body": "Ukraine is preparing for a major Russian operation in the east of the country, now that Russian troops have withdrawn from the areas around the capital, Kyiv.\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the battle for the Donbas region would remind the world of World War Two.\nMr Kuleba asked Nato countries to provide weapons to fight the Russians.

I spent 25 nights like this.\"\nMykola said you couldn't move at all for fear of stepping on people. \nWhen people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. Russian soldiers would not allow it every day. And because of the constant fighting outside - mortar shelling, explosions and gunfire - it was dangerous as well.\nSharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv\nRussian troops were heard discussing killing civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, in messages intercepted by German intelligence, German media say.\nDer Spiegel magazine says some of the radio traffic tracked by the BND intelligence agency appears to match locations of bodies just outside Kyiv.\nThe BND has so far made no public comments on the issue.\nUkraine says more than 300 civilians were killed by the Russians in Bucha - Moscow denies any involvement.\nRecent images of Bucha streets strewn with bodies have shocked the international community. Some of the victims appeared to have been shot in the back of the head after their hands were tied.\nRead the full story here\nThe Bucha killings have sparked widespread accusations of war crimes - with some voices arguing that Moscow has gone even further.\n\"That is real genocide, what you have seen here,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a visit to Bucha.\nPoland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki agrees the killings in Bucha and other towns near the capital \"must be called acts of genocide and be dealt with as such\".\nAnd UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said attacks on civilians in Bucha do not \"look far short of genocide\".\nBut the US and the West's Nato military alliance have stopped short of using the word to describe what's happening in Ukraine.\nSo is there a case for accusing Russian forces of committing what has been called the \"crime of all crimes\"?\nFootage has emerged which purports to show Ukrainian forces shooting and killing a captive Russian soldier.\nIt was filmed on a road to the west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, where Russian forces have been retreating.\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Thursday he was aware of the video and it would \"definitely be investigated\".\nThe BBC has been analysing the footage - here is what we have found out so far.\nRussia's military offensive in eastern Ukraine is already intensifying. You can see it in the long queues of traffic driving west towards relative safety. You can feel it in the deserted streets as you drive through the towns and cities of the Donbas.

In multiple interviews in Obukhovychi, villagers say they were taken from their homes at gunpoint and held in a school by Russians trying to stop advancing Ukrainian forces. Local people also gave accounts of Russian troops shooting civilians and holding others captive in and around Ivankiv, the neighbouring town.\nOn the night of 14 March, Russian soldiers in Obukhovychi were under attack and losing men and armoured vehicles. The Ukrainians were regaining territory. \nAs darkness fell, local people, sheltering in their cellars, heard explosions and the grinding sound of armoured vehicles manoeuvring.\nThey had been under Russian occupation since the start of the invasion - the area was on the main axis of Russian advance. Obukhovychi is 100km (60 miles) from Kyiv, close to Belarus and just south of the exclusion zone around the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. \nWe have now managed to speak to many people about what happened that night. They all told us the same stories about 24 hours that traumatised the village.\nFamilies described how the Russians went door-to-door, rounded them up at gunpoint, and marched them to the local school - where the Russian forces used them as protection. \nMany of the houses in the village had the Ukrainian word for \"people\" painted on their gates - a way of warning soldiers to be careful and not hurt them. But, in the end, the signs were a magnet to Russian troops.\nWe were told that if people didn't open their doors, the Russians broke them down. About 150 civilians, including the elderly and small children, were taken from their cellars to the school.\n\"The [Russians] are fascists, vandals. It was chaos, children and people crying\u2026 I don't want to talk about the Russians. They're not human beings,\" 60-year-old Ivan told us. \nLydmila Sutkova described the terror of being rounded up at the school. \"When explosions came, we thought if the ceiling falls this will become a mass grave.\"\nOthers told us that some of the Russian soldiers were drunk, and threatened to take them to Belarus.\nMaria Bilohovost, an 89-year-old great grandmother, told us she had survived World War Two and that the Russian invaders were like the Germans. \"Except they spoke Russian, so I knew what they were saying.\" \nShe said the Russians left her in the house but took the rest of her family - including her granddaughter Maryana and great-granddaughter Marharyta. Maryana says two-year-old Marharyta still shows signs of anxiety.\nMaryana's mother Olena tells us that she was afraid they would all be shot in the gym. \"I was scared for my daughter. I don't have the words. I'm still frightened. Machine guns - a two-year-old girl should not see this.\"\nOlena says that while the Russians were occupying the village, young women and girls hid inside their homes. \"We were really terrified. One lady went to collect wood for the fire in her house - she was shot in the leg. They just did it for fun.\"\nIn Obukhovychi, there was no mass slaughter of civilians - but we were told stories of individuals, including a local priest, being killed. \nUp the road, the nearby village of Termakhivka is built around a desolate crossroads, where routes lead to Belarus, Chernobyl, Warsaw and Kyiv. There were burnt out military vehicles and military emplacements - once held by the Russians, we were told, but now manned by Ukrainians.\nOne local man, 25-year-old Bogdan, says he was held captive for 15 days outside in sub-zero temperatures - often bound and gagged - by Russian troops. He rolled up his trouser leg to show where a Russian had shot him.\n\"He put me on a bench near the house, aimed his machine gun at me and shot my knee\u2026 the reason is that I have a younger brother. He served in the army. They found his military cap and his military photos.\"\nBogdan also took us across a waterlogged field to show us a patch of disturbed ground - which he said was a shallow grave. The Russians forced him to dig the hole, he explains, so they could bury the body of a man who had been shot. \nGetting to these villages was a hard slog. It meant going the long way round, across pontoon bridges and along back roads through miles of deep forest. \nThis part of Ukraine is a land of rivers and swamps. It's one reason why the Russian advance stopped. \nNow the Russians have pulled out of this area, it is slowly being reconnected to the rest of the country. While we were there, the Ukrainian army fixed a temporary bridge over a river on the road to the capital, next to the ruins of one the Russians blew up as they were retreating to Belarus. Dozens of volunteers were helping out, lighting fires, making soup, cutting trees, digging up stumps and smoothing out new roadways\nIn areas where Ukrainian forces are in control, evidence is accumulating that Russian troops repeatedly broke the laws of war.\nThe question is how the Russians are treating civilians in the places which they still occupy.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A6A1/production/_124075624_womenonthestreet2.jpg", "alt": "Image shows Jeremy Bowen interviewing women on the street"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3171/production/_124075621_school3.jpg", "alt": "Image shows school building"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F4C1/production/_124075626_mariabilhovst-1.jpg", "alt": "Image shows old woman wearing shawl"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/CDB1/production/_124075625_daa518d7-5d30-4e25-85e8-93b029b3fdce.png", "alt": "Image shows map of villages north of Kyiv"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/142E1/production/_124075628_bogdan'skneegunshotscar.jpg", "alt": "Image shows bullet wound to knee"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/169F1/production/_124075629_bombedbridge.jpg", "alt": "Image shows destroyed bridge"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-61018959", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Ukraine War: Veterans prepare for battle in occupied Luhansk"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 04:22:08"}, {"article_body": "The sound of Russian artillery grew louder as we drove to a Ukrainian frontline position in Luhansk.

He told me \"I see the Russians, they look like me\". \nBut he was ready to hold the line. He said \"if they try to take our position, I will kill them. If I don't kill them, they will kill me.

He told me \"we have good weapons and good fortifications and if Russia attacks us here they will lose\". \nThe troops say they've been supplied with western weapons such as javelin anti-tank missiles. They were grateful, but were hoping for more. \nAndrej said that President Putin is a \"psycho\" but he added that his dead Russian soldiers would be good fertiliser for the soil.\nThe troops looked weary from the fighting, but all said morale was high. \nRoman, a deputy commander, had spent four years studying psychology at Lviv University. As well as fighting he was able to offer his men mental health support. \nBut he said \"usually people don't need my help. They have a good motivation for fighting for their family, friends and home, unlike the Russians\", who he dismissively described as \"zombies\".\nThe Ukrainian troops are all well aware that Russia is redeploying more forces to the east. They know that worse is to come. \nBut Roman believes that Ukraine's forces are more tactically astute.

The alliance now has 30 members.\nMembers agree to come to one another's aid in the event of an armed attack against any individual member state.\nBecause Ukraine isn't a Nato member, the alliance isn't obliged to come to the country's defence.\nAnd Nato countries fear that if their troops confront Russian forces in Ukraine, it could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West. \nNato says its members are \"determined to do all we can to support Ukraine,\" but must ensure the war doesn't escalate beyond Ukraine's borders. \nThis is why Nato rejected imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. \nHowever, it has approved sending four new battlegroups to Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania - three of which border Ukraine - doubling Nato's presence in the region. \nNato offered Ukraine a path towards membership in 2008. After Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine made joining a priority.\nBut this hasn't happened, mainly because of Russia's long-standing opposition.\nOne of Russia's demands before the invasion was that Ukraine should never be allowed to join - something the alliance refused to support.\nRussia fears Nato is encroaching on its territory by taking on new members from eastern Europe, and that admitting Ukraine would bring its forces into its backyard.\nUkraine's President Zelensky has accepted his country can't join Nato at present, saying: \"It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand this.\"\nAhead of the Nato meeting in Brussels, the UK said it would provide 6,000 new defensive missiles and \u00a325m to help Ukraine pay its armed forces. \nThe UK has already supplied more than 4,000 shoulder-mounted NLAW anti-tank missiles. It has also sent some Starstreak missiles. \nIt has also given body armour, helmets and boots. \nIn addition, the UK has deployed Sky Sabre, a long-range air defence system to Poland, along with 100 military personnel to operate it. \nThe US initially sent $200m (\u00a3152m) and then a further $350m (\u00a3267m) of weapons. This included Javelin missiles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and body armour. \nThe US has since announced a $1bn (\u00a3760m) security aid package. This includes more sophisticated longer-range weapons such as Switchblade anti-tank drones.\nThe Czech Republic says it is supplying weapons worth $45m (\u00a334m), including tanks and infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs).\nThe EU has said it will spend up to 450m euros (\u00a3376m) to fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine. It is the first time in its history that the EU has helped provide arms for a warzone.\nGermany, too, has dropped its long-standing restrictions on supplying weapons to a combat area. It is sending \"several dozen\" IFVs to Ukraine.      \nThe Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia are among those also sending military equipment, including ammunition, fuel and rations. \nEven before the latest deployments are agreed, Nato already had troops stretching from the Baltic republics in the north to Romania in the south. \nThey were stationed there in 2014, after Russia's annexation of Crimea and are designed to act as a \"tripwire\" in case of a Russian attack.\nNato has sent elements of its 40,000-strong Response Force to Eastern European countries bordering Russia and Ukraine. \nIt has 100 fighter jets on high alert and 120 ships, including three carrier groups, patrolling the seas from the far north to the eastern Mediterranean. \nThe US has committed to sending more troops to Europe - joining the existing four multinational battlegroups Nato has in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, and its multinational brigade in Romania.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13ED4/production/_123002618_nato.jpg", "alt": "Nato soldiers in Serbia, 2021"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4956/production/_122647781_nato_member_states_10jan_map640-2x-nc.png", "alt": "A graphic showing Nato's expansion since 1997"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CAA2/production/_123747815_gettyimages-1233120752.jpg", "alt": "Ukrainian soldier with a Javelin"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/136DD/production/_123418597_8b56c4db-6350-4bed-86d8-2bcefebbbd74.png", "alt": "Turkish fighter jets on patrol for Nato over Poland"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61031683", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Rabid fox bites nine people on US Capitol Hill"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 18:52:34"}, {"article_body": "A rabid fox has been \"humanely euthanised\" after at least biting nine people - including a congressman and a journalist - in Washington DC. \nThree fox kits have also been put down after their mother was trapped and confirmed to have the disease.\nThe fox attacks stirred up a frenzy on Capitol Hill, frequented by many politicians, as well as on Twitter. \nOfficials are urging residents to report encounters with any aggressive, sick or injured foxes.\nReports of an aggressive fox began on Monday.

The BBC understands she has said she would eventually like to return there. \nIf she lived in the UK for 15 years she would automatically lose her non-dom status, under the rules, but she has declined to say when it came into effect.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Sunak had \"very serious questions to answer\" about his family's finances.\n\"If it now transpires that his wife has used schemes to reduce her tax, while he's been increasing taxes on working people, that's breathtaking hypocrisy,\" said Sir Keir.\nIt \"just goes to show just how out of touch this chancellor is\" at a time when taxes are increasing for millions of workers, he added.\nLabour has written to the chancellor demanding to know if he has benefited from Ms Murty's tax status.\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: \"Sunak now needs to come clean about which country his family pays tax in abroad and if it is a tax haven.\" \nThe Lib Dems have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a \"loophole\".\nBut Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng defended Mr Sunak, saying it was \"completely unfair\" to scrutinise the tax affairs of Ms Murty, \"who is not a politician\".\nHe also rejected opposition claims that she was \"sheltering\" from UK taxes.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \"I think she's been very clear, she's been very transparent, the chancellor's been very transparent, and this non-dom status has been part of the UK tax system for more than 200 years.\"\nWhen asked about the criticism of Mr Sunak over his wife's tax affairs, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"I think it's very important in politics to keep people's families out of it.\".\nLast week, Mr Sunak told the BBC it was \"very upsetting\" to see his wife being criticised in the media, as she was not an elected politician.\nA non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK.\nA domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning.\nFor proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried.\nNon-domiciled tax status was introduced in 1799 to protect colonial investments during the time of the British Empire. Those who have it must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time by stating on your tax return that you intend to live in the UK and wish to be considered British for tax purposes.\nMs Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty, which means she doesn't need to pay taxes in the UK on dividends she receives from her stake in her dad's company, thought to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds.\nNon-dom status has been a frequent source of political controversy.\nWealthy Conservative politicians, such as former party chairman Lord Ashcroft and environment minister Lord Goldsmith, have faced criticism over claiming it, although Lord Goldsmith has now given up his non-dom status.\nMs Murty confirmed her non-dom status after it was reported by the Independent website on Wednesday.\n\"Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents' home,\" her spokeswoman said.\n\"India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes.\n\"She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.\"\nBut tax experts have questioned her statement, suggesting that non-dom status is a \"choice\" that people can give up.\n\"Domicile has nothing to do with a person's nationality,\" said Professor Richard Murphy, co-founder of left-wing campaign group the Tax Justice Network.\nHe added: \"Just because a person has Indian citizenship will never automatically grant them non-dom status in the UK.\"\nMs Murty was born in India in 1980 and holds an Indian passport. \nIn 2009, she married Mr Sunak, who became the MP for Richmond, North Yorkshire, in 2015. The couple, who have two daughters, have a flat in Downing Street, and own a number of properties in the UK  including a \u00a31.5m home in his constituency, and a property in Santa Monica, California.\nMs Murty's father founded the IT services company Infosys which has grown to be one of India's biggest firms. She owns a little under 1% of its shares, worth more than \u00a3500m. She also has interests in several companies in the UK.\nLast month the Telegraph reported Ms Murty would have received \u00a311.6m in dividends from Infosys in the past tax year. Her non-dom status means she would not have had to pay UK tax on those dividends, which is currently charged at a rate of 39.35%.\nIndian tax authorities say dividend income is taxable at the rate of 20% for non-residents unless they qualify for any deductions. But the dividend rate can come down to 10% for people who are eligible to benefit from the UK's tax treaty with India.\nAsked if Ms Murty paid tax on her Infosys dividend payments in India, her representative said \"international tax\" was paid on her \"international income\".\nIt is not clear, however, whether she pays tax on her dividend income in India or another jurisdiction.\nIn its letter to Mr Sunak, Labour asked if his wife pays all foreign tax in India or in a tax haven such as the Cayman Islands.\nMr Sunak made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's tax status as part of his declaration of interests when he first became a government minister in 2018.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13192/production/_123962287_sunak_murty.jpg", "alt": "Rishi Sunak and Akshata Murty"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1848/production/_98761260_onlinebanner_976x280.jpg", "alt": "Reality Check branding"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-60978798", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Pakistan court rules Imran Khan no-confidence vote block is illegal"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 17:02:07"}, {"article_body": "Pakistan's top court has ruled that a move to block a parliamentary vote against Prime Minister Imran Khan was unconstitutional, paving the way for his possible removal.\nOn Sunday, Mr Khan's ruling party refused to hold a no-confidence vote which would have ousted him.\nHis government then dissolved parliament and called a snap election.\nThe political blindside outraged the opposition which immediately launched an appeal with the Supreme Court.\nMr Khan, meanwhile, claimed without evidence that the political opposition was in a conspiracy with the US to remove him because of his friendly relations with Russia and China.

We need to make the best possible use of the window this truce gives us to work towards ending the conflict,\" Mr Grundberg said.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12211/production/_124075247_mediaitem124075246.jpg", "alt": "Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi announces that he is transferring his powers to a new leadership council (7 April 2022)"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13DCD/production/_124075318_33e930d7-0414-4150-8e13-2b4da2b1d2f6.jpg", "alt": "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (L) shakes hands with chairman of Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi (R), in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (7 April 2022)"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-africa-61015960", "page_details": [{"post_title": "The Ghana village where deaf couples were outlawed"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 12:38:36"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-61014750", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Devon and Cornwall near misses caught on camera"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 08:06:32"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-60983643", "page_details": [{"post_title": "The siege of Sarajevo 30 years on: \u2018We felt forgotten'"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-05 23:01:19"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-60996098", "page_details": [{"post_title": "A Ukrainian man has to choose between his family and his country"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-05 23:01:16"}, {"article_body": ""}, {"images": []}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-60993769", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Colombia ex-fighters brew up new lives after giving up guns"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 03:50:42"}, {"article_body": "\"Tropics - Fruits of Hope\" is the inspirational name former rebels in Colombia have chosen for their new venture.\nA premium coffee, \"Fruits of Hope\" is grown, harvested and roasted by more than 1,000 guerrilla fighters who laid down their arms following the signing of a peace agreement between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) and the government in 2016.\nLast week, a former rebel came to London to promote \"Fruits of Hope\" - a special edition marking the fifth anniversary of the peace agreement - at the annual London Coffee Festival.\nThe combatants-turned-coffee growers hope their latest product will be as successful as their \"Spirit of Peace Ex Combatants\", which was named \"Best of the Best\" at the Ernesto Illy International Coffee Award in 2019.\nThey are among almost 13,000 former Farc guerrillas who have joined the Colombian government's process of reincorporation into civilian society.\nRather than hiding their past, many make a virtue of their unusual entry into the labour market by alluding to it in the names they give their products. \nOne of the beers they brew is named \"La Trocha\", Spanish for the small paths used by the rebels to criss-cross the Colombian jungle. Clothes designed and made by one of their co-operatives were shown at the fashion show \"Pazarela\", a play on the Spanish words for peace (paz) and catwalk (pasarela).\nThe man who has travelled from the coffee-growing Cauca region to London to promote \"Fruits of Hope\" also does not hide his past. \n\"My name is Antonio Pardo,\" he says, automatically giving his nom de guerre.\nAsked why he still uses the alias instead of his family name, he explains that he no longer associates it with the conflict in which he fought for 10 years. \n\"It's not a nom de guerre to me, it's a peace name now,\" he says, adding that most of his friends and former comrades would not recognise the name Jhon Jairo Moreno. \"That's just the name on my ID and, of course, the one my family calls me.\"\nMr Pardo, who joined the Farc as an 18-year-old sociology student in the city of Cali, says that he and his fellow ex-combatants are 100% committed to peace now.\nHe says that in his rebel cell, made up of 50 fighters, everyone embraced the peace process that put an end to the decades-long conflict in which 260,000 people were killed.  \n\"There came a point at which we recognised that the majority of people in our country wanted an end to the violence.\"\nHe adds that there were elements both on the political far right and far left who wanted the conflict to carry on, but insists that the vast majority of those in the Farc signed up to the peace deal. \nMr Pardo describes the years which followed as \"traumatic\".\nIt took much longer than expected to house those who had demobilised. And out of their jungle hideouts, the newly disarmed rebels became sitting ducks for other armed groups looking to settle old scores.\n\"There were failures on the part of the government, failures they described as delays. But those delays could be deadly for us,\" he says referring to the more than 300 demobilised Farc rebels who have been killed since the 2016 signing of the peace agreement. \nMr Pardo himself became the target of an assassination attempt last October when a gunman tried to open fire at a restaurant. The former rebel was lucky, the gun jammed and the assailant fled after being confronted by one of Mr Pardo's bodyguards.\nThere are also Farc offshoots - groups that did not agree with the peace deal and refused to lay down arms - which continue to mount attacks in Colombia. \nColombian security sources put the number of these dissidents at 2,400 and describe them as one of the biggest dangers to the country's security.\nMr Pardo insists that while these dissident groups may be led by some former Farc members, their rank and file is mainly made up of newly recruited fighters.\nAnd it is this facility to recruit people willing to take up arms which he sees as a continuing threat to peace in Colombia.\nBut he says that the work demobilised Farc members are doing in coffee co-operatives and other reincorporation projects is building trust between former rebels and the community at large.\nThe head of Colombia's Agency for Reincorporation and Normalisation (ARN), Andr\u00e9s Felipe Stapper, says that involving local communities in the reintegration of the rebels has been key to the programme's acceptance.\nHe says that the idea is for locals to benefit from the projects, such as the building of housing and the paving of roads, and that in many cases they work alongside former rebels.\nOften the ideas for the projects come from the ex-rebels themselves, he says.\nMr Stapper's favourite is Cagu\u00e1n Expeditions, which offers white-water rafting tours guided by a mixed team of locals and former guerrilla fighters on a river running through a former rebel stronghold.\nIn 2019, the eight guides were invited to the World Rafting Championships in Australia. The team may not have been part of the official competition but the international recognition they received did its part towards bolstering reincorporation efforts back in Colombia.\nAntonio Pardo, who made the move from rebel to coffee grower, is adamant that despite the risks he and others still face it is time to put thoughts of retribution aside.\n\"What the country wants is for the war to stop, so there are no more victims so that we can all move forward together.\"   \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1AFA/production/_124060960_img_6310.jpg", "alt": "Antonio Pardo (right) and the head of Colombia's Agency for Reincorporation in London"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/902A/production/_124060963_ffc88gwwqaqtzan-1.jpg", "alt": "Two tins of Tropicos coffee"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/176A2/production/_124060959_proyectosproductivosdeexcombatientes-15.jpg", "alt": "Bottles of La Trocha beer"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6CB2/production/_124062872_gettyimages-641252134.jpg", "alt": "A general view inside a demobilization camp where two FARC fighters pass by an automatic assault rifle and a vest hanging on a tree on January 17, 2017 in Vereda La Elvira, Colombia."}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/35E5/production/_121979731_gettyimages-1164614402.jpg", "alt": "Leaders of Segunda Marquetalia"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12C6A/production/_124060967_proyectosproductivosdeexcombatientes-1.jpg", "alt": "A photo of the team at Cagu\u00e1n Expeditions whitewater rafting"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-africa-60996104", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Black Coffee - the South African DJ who made history at the Grammys"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-06 23:32:03"}, {"article_body": "South African DJ Black Coffee has always decried the pigeon-holing of African music on to the side-stage as opposed to what he called the \"main stage\" of music events and festivals. \nNow, the musician, whose real name is Nkosinathi Maphumulo, is celebrating a long-held ambition after winning a Grammy award for Best Dance/Electronic Album for his seventh studio record, Subconsciously - the first African to win this category. Most previous African Grammy winners have achieved their awards in the World Music category. \n\"My phone went absolutely crazy the second the award was announced,\" Black Coffee told the BBC. \"Hearing that I had won, and then going up on stage to accept the award, still feels incredibly surreal and probably will for a little while.\"\nThe superstar DJ - who has performed to hundreds of thousands of people at America's prestigious Coachella music festival, in Ibiza and clubs around the world - had wanted his latest record to gain international recognition. \nWearing an all-white suit and accompanied by his son to collect his first Grammy, the DJ, producer and songwriter was for once lost for words and simply started his acceptance speech with the word \"wow\". \nOn his way up to get the award he embraced French DJ David Guetta, who featured on the album: \"I saw David on my way up to the stage to accept the award and we shared a brief, special moment.\"\nHe gave special thanks to all those who featured on Subconsciously, including another global star, Pharrell Williams. \n\"The main reason I do what I do is to carry the flag of my country. To be recognised in this way outside of a 'World Music' category makes all of the hard work worth it,\" said Black Coffee.\nNow, he wants to use his music, which he describes as \"home-brewed but future focused\", to help more African musicians get recognition on a global stage. \nSuccess did not come overnight for Black Coffee, who describes his music as an acquired taste.  \nThe 46-year-old was born in the port city of Durban, but at the age of eight, he moved to a house in the town of Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, where there was no running water or outside toilets and he had to carry out daily chores such as milking his grandmother's cows. He was desperate to get out and do something greater with his life.\nBeing part of his cousin's sound system crew for parties offered him the first glimpse into his future. \nBut at the age of 14 tragedy struck. On the eve of Nelson Mandela's release from prison, Black Coffee was out celebrating with friends. Suddenly a car ploughed into the crowd and inflicted permanent injury, causing him to lose the use of his hand. \nBut this did not stop him from pursuing his music dream. He was driven and continued to practise. \nIt wasn't until 1994 that his music career began in earnest, and it would be another 10 years before his big break.   \n\"I knew him in the early 2000s and like lots of other kids he would give me his demo tapes and I wasn't feeling the music,\" DJ Oscar Mdlongwa, known as Oskido, told the BBC. \nMdlongwa is considered one of the pioneers of kwaito, a gritty fusion of low-tempo house music and urban African vibes, which preceded the now globally recognised Afro-house and amapiano genres.  \nA few years later, Black Coffee found out where Mdlongwa lived, went there and made him sit down to listen to his new project - a retake of old classics by legendary South African artists.   \nMdlongwa was impressed and gave the young musician an opportunity, helping him to create his record label Soulstic, from which his award-winning debut album Black Coffee, was released in 2005. The album featured a remix of Hugh Masekela 1970s' classic, Stimela.\n\"When I met him, he was a guy who was looking to be heard, for the world to hear him and some people didn't believe in what he was doing,\" Mdlongwa recalls, highlighting Maphumulo's willingness to \"sacrifice\".\nAfter huge success in South Africa, Black Coffee start marketing himself overseas, sometimes playing for free, even in Europe, not knowing anyone and willing to starve, until he made it.\nHe is now one of the most famous DJs in the world.\nBlack Coffee hopes his win will help shine a light on African musical talent.\n\"More and more artists from the continent are starting to break through to a more mainstream audience, and I'm hoping this will just continue to increase over time,\" he said, highlighting the what he calls the unmatched talent coming out of Africa.\nHis success has inspired other South African musicians.\n\"We were due for a Grammy win of this magnitude and it will open new markets for South African artists,\" Afro-jazz artist Simphiwe Dana told the BBC.  \nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa agrees.\n\"Thank you for flying the flag and inspiring a new generation of talent to take over the world,\" he said. \nHis success comes at a time when the influence of South African music is already growing around the world, thanks to a new genre called amapiano. A fusion of soul, Afro-house music and heavily synthesised piano, shares of global streams on the AmaPianoGrooves playlist on Spotify have increased 116% globally over the past year, according to Rolling Stone magazine. \nHelping African children is a recurring theme of his. On Sunday he had a message to them, as well as for all those from an impoverished background who do not think they stand a chance.\n\"It's not about music alone but anything that they want to do. The Grammy is a symbol that [it] is possible to get here.\" \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2CDA/production/_124028411_mediaitem124028410.jpg", "alt": "Black Coffee with his Grammy award"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FFD4/production/_124029456_mediaitem124029455.jpg", "alt": "Black Coffee accepting his Grammy award alongside his son"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3C84/production/_124029451_mediaitem124028417.jpg", "alt": "Black and white photo of Black Coffee performing at Coachella"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-61003270", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Twitter confirms it is working on an edit button"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-06 03:42:29"}, {"article_body": "Twitter has confirmed that it is working on an edit button that would allow users to change tweets after they have been posted. \nIt comes after new board member, Tesla boss Elon Musk, asked his followers in a Twitter poll whether they wanted the feature. \nMany users have long called for an edit button but there are concerns about how to execute it.\nTwitter said it would start testing the idea in the coming months. \nThe social media firm's communications team tweeted: \"Now that everyone is asking\u2026 yes, we've been working on an edit feature since last year! \n\"No, we didn't get the idea from a poll \ud83d\ude09,\" it added. \n\"We're kicking off testing within @TwitterBlue Labs in the coming months to learn what works, what doesn't, and what's possible.\"\nUsers of Twitter Blue, the platform's subscription service, get early access to features it is testing.\nUnder an edit function users could be able to fix typos or errors in a tweet without losing any replies, retweets or likes it has already gained.\nJay Sullivan, the company's vice president of consumer product, said it had been \"the most requested Twitter feature for many years\" in a thread on Tuesday. \nHowever, he said the company was exploring how to build the feature \"in a safe manner\".\n\"Without things like time limits, controls, and transparency about what has been edited, Edit could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation,\" he said. \"Protecting the integrity of that public conversation is our top priority when we approach this work.\"\nDuring a talk in 2018, former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey said the firm would \"probably never\" add the feature amid concerns about transparency. \nBut rival social media platforms Facebook and Instagram already allow users to edit their posts, and Twitter's new boss Parag Agrawal appears open to the idea. \nElon Musk started a poll on Monday after disclosing that he owned a 9.2% stake in Twitter, which made him the firm's biggest shareholder.\nOn Tuesday it was announced that he had been appointed to Twitter's board.  \nThe poll has already attracted over four million votes.\nTwitter initially said it was exploring an edit button on 1 April but it was widely interpreted as an April Fool's joke.\nTwitter says it was already working on an edit button before Elon Musk was appointed to its board. \nBut it does certainly look like the Tesla boss has moved the process along. \nTwitter polls are notoriously unscientific - yet Mr Musk appears to make real-life decisions based on their results. \nIn November last year, he asked his 80 million followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock.

Shah's enterprise is based in Karnataka's capital, Bangalore, India's booming info-tech hub. \nHer remarks came in the wake of a blistering controversy over demands by radical Hindu groups in the state to ban Muslim traders from setting up stalls at temple fairs. These groups have also been urging Hindus not to buy meat sold by Muslim butchers who kill the animal under the requirements of the community's halal slaughter. (The animal's throat is slit quickly with a sharp knife while it is still conscious.) Now the groups are seeking a ban on the use of loudspeakers in mosques, and a boycott of Muslim mango sellers.\nThat's not all. In the past months, Karnataka has been roiled by tension over a government order barring entry to colleges of Muslim girls wearing hijab. A court has upheld the order, and many students have skipped exams and classes in protest.  \nLast year, the government banned trade and slaughter of cows in a state where some 13% of people are Muslims. There are plans to include the Hindu holy book Bhagvad Gita in the school curriculum, and a proposal to remove a chapter on Tipu Sultan, the 18th Century Muslim ruler of Mysore, because it glorifies him. \nMany of these moves have polarised opinion, with critics seeing them as attempts at marginalising Muslims by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nationalist government. But this, many fear, could also backfire and end up sullying the image of one of India's relatively prosperous states.\nMs Shaw tagged Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai in her tweet and said Karnataka had \"always forged inclusive economic development\". If [the city] of information and biotechnology \"became communal\", it would \"destroy its global leadership\", she said.\nHer concerns are understandable. Karnataka's economic success flows from Bangalore. More than 60% of the state's revenues are generated from this lively and chaotic city of some 10 million people.  It's home to more than 13,000 technology start-ups. Some 40% of India's 100-odd unicorns - unlisted companies with a valuation of more than $1bn - are based here. Thanks to Bangalore, the state generates 41% of India's info-tech exports. \nYet Bangalore - and Karnataka - has been a divided place and experienced religious violence in the past. The info-tech industry bypassed Bangalore's \"internal conflicts\" by basing itself on the outskirts, creating its own infrastructure and controlling the imaging of the city, said Narendra Pani, a professor of economics at the city's National Institute of Advanced Studies. \nKarnataka is central to Mr Modi's push to expand the BJP's fledgling footprint in the southern India. It is only one of five southern states where the party has won power. In a state which has a medley of castes, linguistic groups and religions, the BJP has won a majority of the parliamentary seats in four successive general elections. \nFor years, in the state's coastal regions and villages, where a sizeable number of Muslims live, the BJP has pursued a politics of strident Hindu nationalism. The RSS, the BJP's ideological fountainhead, has dug deep roots here. In the past, Hindu groups have tried to impose moral policing by attacking young men and women in pubs, and run campaigns against \"love jihad\", a term radical Hindu groups use to accuse Muslim men of converting Hindu women by marriage.   \nFor long, electoral politics in Karnataka was determined mainly by caste allegiances. BS Yeddyurappa, who led the BJP to its first win in 2008, forged a successful coalition of Lingayats - who account for about a sixth of the state's voters - and other disadvantaged castes. But a faction of Lingayats want themselves to be treated as a separate faith from Hinduism, and there are demands among the disadvantaged castes for increased affirmative action. \"Under pressure, the BJP is now trying to forge a different politics. It is trying to create an electorate based on Hindu nationalism and development,\" said Sugata Srinivasaraju, biographer of HD Deve Gowda, the only Indian prime minister to hail from Karnataka.  \nMr Bommai, a low profile 61-year-old politician, took over from Mr Yeddyurappa last year. Critics say his government's performance has been underwhelming. There have been allegations of mismanagement of the pandemic. An internal review found that half of the government's departments have been underperforming, according to a report in The File, a respected local news and investigation website.  \nCorruption is also holding back development. In a stunning move last November, the state's private contractors wrote to Prime Minister Modi complaining they had to pay up to 40% of a project cost as bribes to ministers and officials. There are reports of unspent development money, unpaid salaries to transport workers and delayed scholarships to the disadvantaged. State elections are due next year. \"Hindu nationalism appears to be the only card the government can play. They have little to show by way of major achievements,\" said Chandan Gowda, a professor of sociology at Bangalore-based Institute for Social and Economic Change.\nA day after Ms Shaw's comments, Mr Bommai appealed to people to \"cooperate in maintaining peace and order\". \"Karnataka is known for peace and progress, and everyone should observe restraint,\" he said. \nThere has been some pushback from within Mr Bommai's party. At least two BJP legislators have minced no words. Banning Muslim traders from Hindu temple festivals is \"nothing but untouchability\u2026 It is an inhuman practice,\" AH Vishwanath told BBC Hindi. Added Anil Benake, \"We will not stop Muslims from doing business at temple festivals.\" In a show of solidarity, Hindus have also lined up outside Muslim butcher shops to buy meat.\nAll this offers hope, but more needs to be done. \"To give Karnataka's politics a religious turn has been a persistent effort for two decades. Over the years, opposition parties, most intellectuals and businesspersons have remained silent or have been calculative in their response. They need to speak out boldly without trying to falsely balance their opinion,\" says Mr Srinivasaraju.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13E57/production/_124059418_330951f4-1459-44b2-9af9-dd332d849cc5.jpg", "alt": "The row over headscarves has sparked countrywide protests"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BD6F/production/_124059484_gettyimages-1239712749-594x594-1.jpg", "alt": "A restaurant cook prepares a dish named kheema roti at a restaurant for the Muslim devotees prior to the breaking of their fast on the first day of the holy fasting month of Ramadan, in Bangalore on April 3, 2022"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6F4F/production/_124059482_gettyimages-536116616-170667a.jpg", "alt": "Residential area and offices in Whitefield, a neighbourhood of Bengaluru, India.

And cowardice leads to tragedies.\"  \nThere is a persistent feeling here that Nato is dragging its feet. \nUkrainians think the West is worried that if it provides too many high-quality weapons, President Putin will use this as a pretext to attack Nato territory - and a much wider and far deadlier war could break out.  \nWestern officials here say this isn't true, and they're puzzled by it.  \nThe US charg\u00e9 d'affaires to Ukraine, Kristina Kvien - currently based in Poland - insists that the US and its allies are pumping weaponry into Ukraine as fast as they can. But she accepts that the Kyiv government will always want more and quicker arms deliveries. \nTanks are now starting to arrive from the Czech Republic - though one lesson of this war so far has been that tanks are horribly vulnerable to drones and shoulder-held missiles. The US is considering providing anti-ship weapons to counter the bombardment of towns and cities along the coast from Odesa eastwards.  \nUkraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov is calling for heavy weapons to counter the Russian forces switching from the Kyiv front to Donbas in the east. This new stage in the fighting will be a lot more challenging for the Ukrainians, whose supply lines will be longer than they were around the capital.  \nPrivately, senior politicians here are worried Ukraine will lose further territory to Russia. And, like the Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, they think this war could go on for a long time.\nIn the meantime the world will presumably see more and more of the terrible destruction which Russian troops have visited on towns and villages around Kyiv. \nExperienced correspondents like the BBC's Jeremy Bowen say the devastation in the small town of Borodyanka is worse for its size than Irpin and Bucha. \nThe expectation is that many more cases of torture and murder will come to light in the days to come.\nThe evidence of war crimes has made Ukraine even more determined to fight back against the invaders. It is also helping to stiffen the resolve of Nato countries whose populations are overwhelmingly against the Russian invasion. \nUkrainian politicians like Mr Zelensky and his colleagues have probably realised that by accusing the West of dragging its feet, they'll encourage people to demand that their governments should do even more to help Ukraine. \nMeanwhile the sanctions which are already being imposed are estimated to set the Russian economy back 15 years. And there are certainly plenty more sanctions to come.  \n\"This has been a textbook example of how not to fight a war,\" says one well-known British military analyst. That is surely true.  \nOn 26 February, only two days after the invasion began, the Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti put out a story celebrating the successful return of Ukraine to the Russian motherland. The article was hurriedly withdrawn, since even by then the war was obviously not going well.  \nThe other day, Dmitry Medvedev, who kept the presidential seat warm for Vladimir Putin for a four-year term between 2008 and 2012, announced that Russia was building a power base that would spread from Vladivostok in the Russian far east to Portugal in the west.  \nStill, just because that kind of boasting sounds ludicrously wide of the mark after six weeks of war, it doesn't mean that Ukraine is starting to plan any victory parades.  \nWe could have a long way to go yet.\nJohn Simpson's programme, Unspun World, is broadcast on BBC2 on Wednesdays, the BBC News channel on Saturdays, and BBC World News on Sundays.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1F47/production/_124070080_gettyimages-1239786748.jpg", "alt": "A house is burning following shelling in Severodonetsk, Donbas region, on April 6, 2022"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7537/production/_124070003_mediaitem124070002.jpg", "alt": "The Ukrainian flag flies outside the town administration building that was damaged during heavy shelling in the town of Derhachi outside Kharkiv, as Russia\"s attack on Ukraine continues, in Ukraine, April 6"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-61027313", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Energy strategy: Boris Johnson defends plan amid cost of living crisis"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 17:18:07"}, {"article_body": "The PM has defended the government's new energy strategy, following criticism it does little to help people struggling with soaring bills. \nBoris Johnson said it was a \"long-term plan\" focused on energy supply and the government had already introduced other policies to tackle rising energy costs. \nThe strategy, which aims to increase UK energy independence, includes plans to boost nuclear, wind and hydrogen power.\nBut Labour said it was \"too little, too late\" to help with rising costs.\nAnd experts called for a bigger focus on energy efficiency and insulation to help bring bills down. \nConsumers are facing huge increases in energy bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed gas prices even higher.\nSpeaking at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, Mr Johnson said the strategy was about \"tackling the mistakes of the past and making sure that we are set well for the future\".\nCiting policies including a \u00a36bn energy efficiency fund and support for heat pumps, he said the government was \"already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more\".\nUnder the government's new plans, up to 95% of the UK's electricity could come from low-carbon sources by 2030.\nThere is a big focus on offshore wind, with a new target of producing up to 50 gigawatts (GW) of energy from this source by 2030. Officials said this would be more than enough to power every home in the UK. \nThe strategy says the government wants to \"lead the world once again\" in nuclear power, reversing what it describes as \"decades of underinvestment\".\nA new body called Great British Nuclear will be launched to bolster the UK's nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 24 GW of electricity will come from that source - 25% of the projected electricity demand.\nThe government hopes to deliver up to eight new reactors, built on existing sites, with a new reactor approved each year until 2030.\nRead more about what the strategy says here.\nFor onshore wind, the strategy commits to consulting on developing partnerships with \"a limited number of supportive communities\" who want to host wind turbines in exchange for guaranteed lower energy bills.\nHowever, the strategy says there will be no \"wholesale changes\" to current planning regulations for onshore wind.\nAlthough it is one of the cheapest forms of energy, new onshore wind projects have been declining since 2015 when the government ended subsidies and introduced stricter planning rules in response to some complaints that wind turbines were an eyesore and noisy.\nDefending the decision not to prioritise onshore wind, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK already had about 30GW of onshore wind capacity.\nHe added that new sites \"will have a very high bar to clear\".\nEnvironmentalists and many energy experts have reacted with disbelief and anger at some of the measures in the strategy.\nThey cannot believe the government has offered no new policies on saving energy by insulating buildings.\nThey say energy efficiency would immediately lower bills and emissions, and is the cheapest way to improve energy security. \nA Downing Street source said the strategy was now being seen as an energy supply strategy.\nCampaigners are also furious that ministers have committed to seeking more oil and gas in the North Sea, even though humans have already found enough fossil fuels to wreck the climate.\nThere is a strong welcome, though, for the promise of more energy from wind offshore with speedier planning consent. \nThe same boost has not been offered to onshore wind.\nThe decision to boost nuclear has drawn a mixed reaction. Some environmentalists say it's too dear and too dangerous. They ridicule the idea from some politicians that every city could have its own mini reactor. \nBut other climate campaigners believe nuclear must be part of the energy mix.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the measures announced were not enough to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. \n\"All we've got today is a cobbled-together list of things that could and should have been done over the last 10 to 12 years and it doesn't even tackle really important things like insulating homes, which could save \u00a3400 on everybody's bill,\" he said.\nThe former boss of energy regulator Ofgem, Dermot Nolan, said: \"Most of these decisions will take a long time to have an impact and in the short run we will continue to be dependent on fossil fuels.\"\nHe said the lack of focus on energy efficiency, insulation and improving the quality of people's homes was \"an opportunity missed\".\nAsked in the Lords why the government was not spending more on improving the insulation of homes, a business minister suggested the Treasury was not willing to support this. \nLord Callanan told peers: \"We're spending something like \u00a36.6bn over the term of this Parliament on insulation schemes. It would have been good to go further but the Treasury wouldn't support it.\"\nGreen Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said if the government was \"concerned about energy bills and taking real climate action, it would be going even further on onshore wind\".\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the plans as \"utterly hopeless\", while the SNP's Stephen Flynn also called it a \"missed opportunity\".\nDr Simon Cran-McGreehin, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the strategy was \"underwhelming\", describing the lack of funding to improve energy efficiency in homes as \"an enormous gaping hole\". \nHe added that there appeared to be \"limited ambition\" for onshore wind, despite it being \"remarkably popular\". \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6F47/production/_124078482_gettyimages-1390049647.jpg", "alt": "Boris Johnson"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/13297/production/_124078487_nuclear_reactors_uk2022_640v2-nc.png", "alt": "Graphic showing locations of nuclear power stations in the UK"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png", "alt": "1px transparent line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/15901/production/_112812388__109755658_rogerharrabin_tr-nc.png", "alt": "Analysis box by Roger Harrabin, Environment analyst"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60982346", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Energy: What does the UK's new strategy say?"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 13:09:49"}, {"article_body": "The government has published its long-awaited strategy for increasing the UK's energy independence.\nThe blueprint aims to move away from Russian oil and gas, and boost renewable energy sources.\nMinisters are also under pressure to help tackle soaring energy bills facing consumers, amid rising gas prices.\nThe document has been delayed amid wrangling over the contents. So what's in it?\nThe strategy contains an ambition to deliver up to eight new nuclear reactors before 2030, including two at Sizewell in Suffolk.\nThe government wants nuclear to supply 24 gigawatts (GW) of electricity by 2050 - around 25% of the UK's predicted energy demand.\nThe UK currently has 15 reactors that can supply about 20% of demand - with most due to cease operating before the end of the decade.\nThirteen new reactors are at various stages of development, but funding and approving new sites has presented major challenges in recent years.\nA new government body - called Great British Nuclear - will be set up to oversee the delivery of new nuclear plants.\nThe government also recently acquired new powers to finance new projects by allowing developers to add costs to customers' bills during construction.\nMinisters argue this will prove less expensive for energy customers than current funding models, where these costs can only be added after a station starts generating electricity.\nOffshore wind is also a big part of the plans - with a new target to generate 50GW of energy by 2030.\nMinisters hope around a tenth of this could come from turbines based on floating structures, which can be positioned further from the shore.\nThe government has vowed to relax planning rules to speed up the approvals process from four years to one, and set up a fast-track approvals process for \"priority\" projects.\nA senior source has also told the BBC that Boris Johnson wants to appoint a \"Kate-Bingham like\" figure to oversee new projects - a reference to the venture capitalist who led a government taskforce on Covid vaccines.\nThere will be no new target, however, for onshore wind - which has proved unpopular with some Tory activists and MPs.\nThe government has pledged it will not make \"wholesale changes\" to planning laws in England for onshore sites, which were tightened in 2015.\nInstead, it will consult a \"limited number of supportive communities\" about hosting new sites, in exchange for guaranteed discounts on energy bills.\nLabour has accused the prime minister of \"caving\" to his backbenchers, and not doing enough to boost new onshore sites.\nThere will be a licensing round this summer for new North Sea oil and gas projects, and a taskforce set up to support new developments.\nMinisters say they don't want to burn more gas, but instead produce more of it domestically while they transition to renewables.\nAlongside the strategy, a new scientific study has also been commissioned into fracking - the process of extracting shale gas from the ground.\nThe controversial practice has been subjected to a UK ban since 2019, amid fierce local opposition and fears of earth tremors - but some Tory MPs have been pushing for it to be lifted.\nThe business secretary says the war in Ukraine means it is right to look at \"all possible domestic energy sources\".\nKwasi Kwarteng pledged the ban on fracking would remain in place in England unless scientific evidence showed it is safe and causes \"minimal disturbance\" to nearby residents.\nThere's an ambition to increase the UK's current 14GW solar capacity fivefold by 2035.\nPlanning laws in England will be reviewed to promote the development of new solar farms on non-protected land.\nA consultation will also look at how to make it easier to put solar panels on rooftops, including on public buildings.\nSupporters of solar say a new generation of farms could provide a source of renewable energy to power hundreds of thousands of homes. \nBut plans for new farms have faced local resistance, with a number of Conservative MPs also voicing their opposition.\nThe strategy contains a target to double UK hydrogen production to 10GW by 2030.\nThe ambition is that at least half of this will come from electrolytic hydrogen - where electricity is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.\nThis process of producing the gas can be greener than the most common production route used at the moment, by reacting natural gas with steam.\nLow-carbon hydrogen production in the UK is still at an early stage, with hopes that advances in technology can reduce costs.\nThe target to boost production, however, comes with a caveat - it is \"subject to affordability and value for money\".\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/80FC/production/_124002033_windfarmgetty.jpg", "alt": "Offshore wind farm on Teesside"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/623/cpsprodpb/A719/production/_124077724_hinkleypamedia.jpg", "alt": "The base for the first reactor at Hinkley Point C"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/11954/production/_124002027_teesidewindfarmgettycreative.jpg", "alt": "Offshore wind farm near Teesside"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/16774/production/_124002029_oilrigpamedia.jpg", "alt": "North Sea oil rig"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/32DC/production/_124002031_wymeswoldsolarfarmspl.jpg", "alt": "Solar farm at Wymeswold airfield"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/0AD9/production/_124077720_hydrogensmallgetty.jpg", "alt": "Pipes with H2 written on them"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-61019261", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Will the UK's energy strategy work?"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 06:08:27"}, {"article_body": "It's worth noting what this strategy is -

The heat is then used to boil water, producing steam which drives turbines and generates electricity.\nThis process does not result in greenhouse gas emissions, and requires minimal mining for metals and other resources, but does produce hazardous waste that needs to be stored for a very long time.\nThere are currently six plants that can supply about 20% of UK electricity demand, with 15% generated in 2020. This amount has declined since the 1990s, with several plants reaching the end of their lives.\nMost of the existing reactors are due to cease operating and be shut down before 2030.\nThe government says it wants to deliver up to eight new reactors overall, with one being approved each year until 2030.\nThe government has backed the construction of Hinkley C in Somerset, which will be the largest nuclear station in Britain. \nIt has also confirmed advanced plans to approve two new reactors at Sizewell C in Suffolk, during this parliament. \nWyfla in Anglesey has also been named as a site for a new nuclear power station in the next parliament.\nAs well as larger nuclear power stations, the government is also supporting Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which work in the same way as conventional nuclear reactors, but on a smaller scale.\nThe energy strategy says the UK will collaborate countries such as Canada and the United States to accelerate work on advanced nuclear technologies, including both SMRs and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs). \nNuclear power plants are extremely expensive and complicated to build. Hinkley C - the newest of the UK's planned nuclear power stations - is already expected to be 30% over budget at \u00a322 - \u00a326 bn.  \nThe much smaller SMRs would cheaper, at about \u00a32bn - but obviously also generate significantly less power. \nThe government also hopes a new financial funding model could cut the cost of new nuclear projects. \nBut this could mean electricity customers have to pay part of schemes' costs upfront through their energy bills. \nThere is also the question of the price which will be paid for the energy generated by the UK's new nuclear plants.\nIn 2013, the government agreed to pay \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour ( for the electricity produced by Hinkley Point, which would rise with inflation. \nAlthough this is considerably below current prices which have soared to \u00a3195 per megawatt hour due to the energy crisis, critics argue it is still too much.\nOver the last five years, the price has been between \u00a325 and \u00a350 per megawatt hour, so if prices return to this bro would make nuclear power expensive.\nCritics of nuclear power say they take so long to come on stream they will be too late for the UK's emissions targets or to reduce energy prices.\nIn 2016, EDF Energy said construction of Hinkley Point C would take 10 years - last year it said it was on track to open by the end of 2026, although further delays are possible. \nA new body called Great British Nuclear is now being set up, with the aim of overseeing and speeding up the time it takes to build and make nuclear plants operational.\nThe government also says SMRs are quicker to construct than larger plants due to the smaller parts involved.\nIn mid-2021, 415 civilian nuclear reactors were operating in 33 countries, according to the World Nuclear Industry Status report. \nTogether, the \"big five\" - the US, China, France, Russia, and South Korea - generated 72% of all nuclear electricity in the world in 2020. \nThe industry report says that the nuclear share of the global energy market is steadily declining. \nBut two countries, Belarus and the United Arab Emirates, started their first reactors last year.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, part of the United Nations, says nuclear power plants are among \"the safest and most secure facilities in the world\".\nThey are subject to stringent international safety standards. \nThere was widespread alarm in March when a nuclear power station in Ukraine - the largest in Europe - was hit by shelling before being taken over by Russia.\nAnd there have been some high-profile accidents, where large amounts of radioactive material were released into the environment.\nThe worst nuclear accident in history resulted from an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. A tsunami caused by an enormous earthquake flooded the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011. \nEven under normal conditions, generating nuclear power produces hazardous radioactive waste, which needs to be safely managed and stored for hundreds of years. \nBut a House of Lords paper from October says the issue of nuclear waste remains \"unresolved in the UK\".\nIt is currently stored in temporary facilities that are not designed for the permanent storage of so-called \"high-level\" radioactive waste.\nThe government's preferred solution is \"geological disposal\" - placing waste deep in a rock formation that would prevent radioactivity from escaping. \nHowever, no community has agreed to host such a facility.\nUnlike fossil fuels, nuclear power stations do not produce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide or methane - and 1kg of nuclear fuel produces millions of times more energy than 1kg of coal.\nBut like fossil fuels, nuclear fuels are non-renewable energy resources. \nBuilding new nuclear plants of any size also creates emissions - for example, through manufacturing the large amounts of steel and other materials needed. \nThe long-term environmental consequences of dealing with nuclear waste are also unclear. \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/94FD/production/_123714183_hinkley.jpg", "alt": "Tower cranes are pictured in front of the Hinkley A buildings at the construction site of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station being built near Bridgwater on October 1, 2018"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/15EDB/production/_121491898_optimised-uk_energy_source-nc.png", "alt": "Chart showing UK electricity production by source"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png", "alt": "2px presentational grey line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EEC7/production/_121472116_d84c34a4-e05d-44e6-83f5-5c3dafc3d10a.jpg", "alt": "Small modular nuclear station (artist's impression)"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/11507/production/_121491907_optimised-nuclear_production.png", "alt": "Chart showing the global use of nuclear power"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EDF7/production/_121491906_gettyimages-1225961609.jpg", "alt": "An engineer inspects a turbine in a nuclear power station"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-61026497", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Sabina Nessa: Family calls absent-from-court murderer a coward"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 16:48:12"}, {"article_body": "The family of murdered primary school teacher Sabina Nessa has branded her killer a \"disgusting animal\" and a \"coward\" at his sentencing hearing, which he refused to attend.\nKoci Selamaj, 36, beat and strangled the 28-year-old as she walked through Cator Park, south London, in September.\nSelamaj, who did not know Ms Nessa, pleaded guilty to murder in February. \nMs Nessa's sister Jabina Islam called Selamaj an \"awful human\".

He then tried to cover her body in grass, the court heard.\nHe disposed of the weapon in a river on his way back to Eastbourne.\nThree days before the attack, he booked a room at the five-star Grand Hotel in Eastbourne.\nMs Morgan suggested the booking of a room at the hotel near his home was \"indicative of his premeditation to have some kind of sexual encounter that evening\".\nOn the day of the attack, Selamaj met his former partner, who told the court he appeared \"very agitated\" when they met at his car near the hotel.\nShe said: \"I think that he wanted to have sex in the car. I don't know what was bothering him, but he was very agitated.\"\nShe refused to join him on the back seat and left, the court was told. \nHead teacher Lisa Williams also described the \"devastating\" impact the primary school teacher's murder had had on pupils.\nHer class of 30 students \"will never be able to comprehend why someone murdered their teacher and the world in which they live is not safe for them to play in a park,\" she said in a statement.\nSelamaj initially refused to comment in police interviews but when he was charged, he asked: \"What will happen if I open up now and say everything?\"\nIn mitigation, Lewis Power QC said Selamaj's family, who had attended court, were in \"shock and total disbelief\".\nHe said his client had provided no explanation for why he murdered Ms Nessa, adding: \"He simply accepts that he did it.\"\nMr Justice Sweeney said the \"inevitable\" sentence would be life in prison, with a starting point for a minimum term of 30 years.\nSentencing is expected to take place on Friday.\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

She would not have paid UK tax, at a rate of 39.35%, on the dividends.\nThe \u00a330,000 fee is chargeable if a person has lived in the UK for at least seven of the previous nine years.\nUnder government rules, people can be granted non-dom status - meaning the UK is not considered their permanent home - if they live in the UK but intend to go back to their home country.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Sunak faced \"very serious questions to answer\" about his family's finances, adding: \"If it now transpires that his wife has used schemes to reduce her tax, while he's been increasing taxes on working people, that's breathtaking hypocrisy.\"\nThe Liberal Dems have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a \"loophole\".\nMs Murty is an Indian citizen and has retained family ties there, and the BBC understands she has said she would eventually like to return there.\nShe owns a 0.9% stake in the software firm Infosys - founded by her billionaire father - estimated to be worth more than \u00a3500m.\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng defended Mr Sunak, saying it was \"completely unfair\" to scrutinise the tax affairs of Ms Murty, \"who is not a politician\" and rejecting opposition claims that she was sheltering from UK taxes.\nA non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK.\nA domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning.\nFor proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried.\nThose who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time by stating on a tax return that they intend to live in the UK and wish to be considered British for tax purposes.\nMs Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty, which means she doesn't need to pay taxes in the UK on dividends she receives from her stake in his company.\nMs Murty married Mr Sunak in 2009.\nThe fee for non-dom status rises to \u00a360,000 a year when a person has been in the UK for at least 12 of the previous 14 years.\nAnd anyone living in the UK for 15 years automatically loses the status.\nMs Murty has declined to say when her non-dom status began.\n\"India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously,\" Ms Murty's spokeswoman said. \"So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes.\n\"She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.\"\nBut tax experts have questioned Ms Murty's statement, suggesting UK non-dom status is a \"choice\" and something people can give up.\nAsked if Ms Murty paid tax on her Infosys dividend payments in India, her representative said \"international tax\" was paid on her \"international income\".\nIt is not clear, however, whether she pays tax on her dividend income in India or another jurisdiction.\nThe Indian government says dividend income is taxable at the rate of 20% for non-residents, unless they qualify for any deductions.\nBut the dividend rate can come down to 10% for people who are eligible to benefit from the UK's tax treaty with India.\nIn a letter to Mr Sunak, Labour asked if his wife paid all foreign tax in India or in a tax haven such as the Cayman Islands.\nThe chancellor made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's tax status as part of his declaration of interests when he first became a government minister in 2018.\nLast week, Mr Sunak told the BBC it was \"very upsetting\" to see his wife being criticised in the media, as she was not an elected politician.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FCAF/production/_124078646_mediaitem124078645.jpg", "alt": "Rishi

inquiry: Ex-minister unaware red tape cuts affected fire safety"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 18:28:28"}, {"article_body": "A former housing secretary has admitted to the Grenfell Tower inquiry he did not know a policy of cutting red tape had prevented government officials tightening fire safety standards. \nLord Pickles claimed building standards regulations were exempt from a policy promoted by David Cameron's government.\nBut under questioning he was unable to give an example of where the exemption had been specifically set out. \nThe fire in the west London tower block in 2017 claimed the lives of 72 people.\nLord Pickles said he took full responsibility for any failures in the housing department, which he led in the years of the Cameron coalition government between 2010 and 2015. \nThe inquiry into the disaster is examining what the government did to prevent construction firms from using dangerous materials on tall buildings. \nCombustible cladding and insulation were a cause of the Grenfell Tower fire, and the subsequent building safety crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of flat owners.\nIn his second day giving evidence, Lord Pickles appeared to suggest the inquiry's senior counsel, Richard Millett QC, should speed up his questions as the peer had meetings planned for the afternoon. \nHe later apologised for being \"discourteous\" and said he had decided to cancel his meetings as \"this is more important than anything I'm doing\".\nA key issue for the inquiry centres on the \"one in, one out\" policy of the government at the time which aimed to cut the number of regulations affecting businesses.  \nFor every new regulation introduced, another, and as time went on, another two or three, had to be removed.\nIn 2011 and 2012 the government decided to exempt \"fire safety regulations\" from the policy.  \nHowever the inquiry was shown government documents suggesting the exemption only applied to the safe management of buildings and underground railway stations.\nThe building regulations, and guidance designed to prevent major fires, would continue to be part of the government's approach to regulation, \"not least the one in, one out approach\", according to a submission to ministers in 2012. \nLord Pickles pointed to a single line in a government press release that stated \"essential safety and accessibility protections will remain untouched\" as evidence his department did not intend to erode safety regulations. \nBut asked whether he had ever seen a document in which the building regulations were specifically exempted from the \"war on red tape\", he was unable to give an example. \nThis is a highly significant issue for the Grenfell Inquiry because four government officials, working on fire safety in building construction, have given evidence that the deregulation drive was having an impact on regulations governing \"life safety\". \nOne, the fire policy specialist Brian Martin, had been warned about fires engulfing tower blocks around the world, and concerns dangerous materials were being used in Britain. \nHe gave evidence that tightening the regulations for England would have been \"incredibly difficult\" because \"regulation was a dirty word\" within the government.\nLord Pickles claimed the officials, whom he had never met, were making political assumptions, were poorly managed, involved in a \"grudge\" with a parliamentary committee and \"struggling to cope\" at work.  \nRichard Millett QC asked him to explain the situation and whether the former minister had been \"spectacularly out of touch\" with what was happening in his department.\nLord Pickles responded: \"I think that would be uncharacteristically unjust of you to say that. This is an enormous department. I am utterly reliant on receiving good intelligence from my permanent secretary and director generals.\"\nIn an opening statement to this phase of the long-running public inquiry, the government apologised for \"past failures in relation to the oversight of the system that regulated safety in the construction and refurbishment of high rise buildings.\"\nAsked if he took responsibility for what had happened, Lord Pickles briefly lost his composure, saying: \"I swore on the Bible. I'm a Christian. I wouldn't come here to remove responsibility. These things are important to me.\"\nIn a final statement at the end of his evidence, Lord Pickles said \"ultimately it comes down to the nameless 96 people who were killed in the Grenfell fire\".\nHowever 71 people died as a direct result of the fire and a further death was later linked to it. All have been named.\nThe statement prompted an angry response from Grenfell United, which represents many bereaved, survivors and residents affected by the fire, which said his \"disrespect\" had left members speechless.\n\"His utter disregard for what happened and to those no longer with us is horrifying, given that he had the ability as minister of housing to reform building safety,\" Grenfell United said.\nLord Pickles delayed improvements to the building regulations that were recommended following a previous fatal fire in south London. The changes had not been made by the time of the Grenfell disaster in June 2017.\nThe inquiry is coming to the end of a phase examining the role of the government and will next look at the way it handled the aftermath of the fire in west London. \nIt is expected to finish later this year and report in 2023.  \nA police investigation is also ongoing, and once the inquiry reports, is expected to recommend criminal charges to the Crown Prosecution Service.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16EB4/production/_124067839_hi075110035.jpg", "alt": "Grenfell Tower"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14E22/production/_124083558_hi054639928.jpg", "alt": "A memorial for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/5FD1/production/_112292542_soundsheaderv1-nc.png", "alt": "Around the BBC - Sounds"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/A11C/production/_112244214_soundsfooter-nc.png", "alt": "Around the BBC footer - Sounds"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-61031088", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Cambo: Ithaca Energy pledges to develop controversial oil field"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 20:28:42"}, {"article_body": "The controversial Cambo oil field off Shetland could now be developed after the owner of the field was bought by another energy firm.\nSiccar Point Energy - which put the project on hold when Shell pulled out - has now been acquired by Ithaca Energy in a $1.5bn (\u00a31.125bn) deal.\nThe new company has pledged to develop Cambo and the nearby Rosebank field.\nCampaigners have criticised plans to develop Cambo, warning exploiting it would exacerbate climate change.\nIthaca's chief executive Alan Bruce said Cambo and Rosebank were \"two of the largest undeveloped and most strategically important discoveries\" in UK waters.\nDeveloping them, Mr Bruce added, was a \"huge opportunity to not only help secure the UK's energy future for at least another quarter of a century, but also to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs in the process.\"\nA spokeswoman for Shell,  which still owns a 30% stake in Cambo, told the BBC that it had nothing to add to its statement in December when the oil giant said it had \"concluded the economic case for investment in this project is not strong enough at this time, as well as having the potential for delays.\"\nThe Cambo oil field is thought to contain 800 million barrels of oil, but its development has not yet received final approval from UK government regulators.\nScotland's first minister has also said the project should not get the green light because of concern over climate change.\nThe Scottish government said that unlimited extraction of fossil fuels was not consistent with its climate obligations.\nA spokesman added: \"We have consistently called on the UK government to urgently re-assess all approved oil licenses where drilling has not yet commenced against our climate commitments.\n\"New oil and gas fields do not present a timely solution to improving our energy security in the coming years.

You will be asked to fold the ballot paper and put it in the ballot box. \nYou are not allowed to discuss your vote in the polling station. \nYou're also advised not to take selfies because you could accidentally give away how someone else voted (the person in the booth next to you, for example), which is illegal.\nYou can vote by post, but you need to apply in advance. This means printing and posting an application form to your local council or the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland. Some councils will allow you to send online applications but you should check with your local authority.\nThe deadline to apply to vote by post in England, Scotland and Wales is 17:00 on 19 April, and in Northern Ireland it is 17:00 on 12 April.\nYou will receive your ballot in the post, with instructions on how to cast your vote and return it correctly.\nNominating someone to vote on your behalf is known as a proxy vote. However, you need to have a reason why you cannot vote in person, for example a disability.\nThe deadline for applying for a proxy is 17:00 on 26 April in England, Scotland and Wales, and 17:00 on 12 April in Northern Ireland.\nIn England, Scotland and Wales, in some circumstances - including having Covid - you can apply for an emergency proxy vote until 17:00 on polling day. If you have already signed up to vote by proxy and the person you've nominated has Covid, you have until the same deadline to nominate somebody else.\nEmergency proxy votes are not available in Northern Ireland.\nThe timing of the results depends on when the count begins. In England, just over half of the councils are expected to count overnight on Thursday after polls close, with the rest beginning on Friday morning.\nCounts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all expected to begin on Friday 6 May - so most results should be known by Friday evening.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/175DA/production/_124060759_le_2022_index_promo_how_to_vote-nc.png", "alt": "Ballot box graphic"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1245F/production/_108974847_gettyimages-693731638.jpg", "alt": "A voter walking passed a polling station sign"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/45D6/production/_117887871_gettyimages-528517384.jpg", "alt": "Officials counting ballot papers"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60695244", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Election 2022: Is there an election in my area?"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-06 16:50:12"}, {"article_body": "Voters in many parts of the UK will have the chance to take part in elections this May.\nSearch below to see which elections you can vote in.\nAll 90 seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly are up for grabs with five Members of the Legislative Assembly being elected in each of the 18 constituencies.\nAll the councils in Scotland and Wales are being contested and some councils in England. \nIn Scotland 1,200 seats are up in 32 council areas and in Wales there are 1,200 across 22 councils. \nIn England more than 4,000 council seats are being contested across 146 councils.\nThere are four new councils - unitary authorities in North Yorkshire and Somerset and two in Cumbria.\nThe Mayor of South Yorkshire is also being elected as are six other local authority mayors. \n.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/0983/production/_123953420_optimised-election_map-nc.png", "alt": "Map of areas in the UK with elections"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5AD5/production/_123935232_uk_election_2022_banner_top_640x2-nc.png", "alt": "More on Election 2022 banner"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/81E5/production/_123935233_uk_election_2022_banner_bottom_640x2-nc.png", "alt": "Election banner"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60996950", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Local elections 2022: A simple guide to English council elections"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 12:42:01"}, {"article_body": "Voters in many parts of England get the chance to elect their local representatives on 5 May.\nThe elections will decide who runs services such as social care, bin collections and planning.\nLocal council elections are happening in England, but not in all areas. \nThere are about 4,360 seats up for grabs on about 146 councils, plus a handful of mayoral elections and seats on 1,000 parish councils.\nLocal councils are responsible for providing many of our public services.

and that has already been made trickier due to recent events.\nThe lead jobs in the executive - first minister and deputy first minister - are reserved for the largest party from the largest of the unionist/nationalist blocs and the largest party from the second largest of the blocs.\nDespite their names, the two roles are joint, and one cannot hold office without the other.\nSince 2003, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been the largest party in the assembly, followed by nationalists Sinn F\u00e9in.\nIn February, the DUP withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol.\nIt meant Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill lost her job as deputy first minister and that the executive could not take decisions because the first and deputy first ministers must chair all meetings of it.\nRecent polls have also indicated that Sinn Fein could for the first time win the most seats and be entitled to the first minister role. \nThe DUP has refused to say whether it would agree to share power in this circumstance.\nAfter the last assembly election in March 2017, there were three years of stalemate before the executive was re-established.\nHow long it takes this time and who wants to be part of it will factor into the debate as the parties pound the pavement for votes over the next six weeks.\nSIGN UP FOR ALERTS: Get extra updates on BBC Northern Ireland election coverage\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6853/production/_123870762_gettyimages-647468676.jpg", "alt": "Ballot papers counted in an NI Assembly election"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13B97/production/_123219708_gettyimages-936295522.jpg", "alt": "Carson's statue at Stormont"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4C56/production/_123224591_gettyimages-1233507323.jpg", "alt": "Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7223/production/_123891292_uk_election_2022_banner_bottom_640x2-nc.png", "alt": "Bottom banner"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7223/production/_123891292_uk_election_2022_banner_bottom_640x2-nc.png", "alt": "Bottom banner"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-61021314", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Ed Sheeran, Adele and Inflo up for IvorNovello awards"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 08:08:53"}, {"article_body": "Adele, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Dave and Raye have all been nominated for songwriter of the year at the prestigious Ivor Novello awards.\nProducer and writer Inflo, once called \"the most influential and mysterious producer on the planet\", leads the award nominations, with four in total.\nHe is recognised for his work with Brit Award-winner Little Simz, singer Cleo Sol and funk-soul collective Sault.\nEd Sheeran, who just won a plagiarism battle, is up for three prizes.\nAs well as songwriter of the year, the star has two tracks -

I'm very proud to be in it.\n\"I'm glad in a sense that it was my back,\" he continued, \"because it represents everyone that was involved in the conflict. \n\"It's not just centred on one individual.\"\nMr Robinson, a former corporal with the elite commando force, was in charge of two relatively new Milan anti-tank missiles during the Battle of Two Sisters on the night of 11 June.\n\"I was given permission to open fire and a missile did actually take out the Argentinian machine gun position.\n\"The guys on the ground had never seen this system before, because it was so new.\n\"A voice came over the radio saying, 'I don't know what that was, but could we have another one please?' So there's always humour in the face of adversity.\"\nThe conflict resulted from the long-standing dispute with Argentina over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, which lie in the Atlantic to the east of Argentina. \nThe British government dispatched a naval task force to retake the islands by amphibious assault when Argentine forces invaded on 2 April. \nThe soldiers had to endure the extreme conditions of a South Atlantic winter. There was snow on the ground as they made their way to Stanley to celebrate the end of the campaign.\n\"It was a cold day that day. My hands are clenched together trying to keep my fingers warm,\" Mr Robinson said.\n\"I remember the only way we could dry any of our kit was around our waist so my waist was basically a washing line with all my socks on to get them dry.\"\nThe flag in the photograph has sadly been lost, but the famous picture which became known as The Yomper inspired a three-tonne (472st) statue.\nIn 1992 Robinson was invited to Portsmouth with Margaret Thatcher for the unveiling at the Royal Marines Museum at Eastney.\n\"She said, 'These people haven't only come to see me, but they've come to see you as well,\" Mr Robinson said.\n\"I don't like being turned into a hero. A lot more guys out there did a lot more than what I did. It was just the fact that my photograph became the image.\n\"A lot of Royal Marines remember this photograph. Some of the younger guys come up to me and say, 'you're the reason I joined.'\n\"I always apologise profusely.\"\nMany soldiers who served in the Falklands conflict have suffered from PTSD. Some veterans have even taken their own lives as cases have gone undiagnosed for years. \nMr Robinson said he feels fortunate to have been able to put his experiences behind him.\n\"I was 24-years-old at the time. Somewhere in the back of my mind those memories are still there, but I've built a brick wall and keep them to the back and get on with life.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

something the Scottish government has also dismissed as not a short-term solution to energy concerns.\nThe UK government is setting out a new energy strategy, which includes plans to increase wind, hydrogen and solar power production.\nIt also aims to accelerate the use of nuclear power, with up to eight more nuclear reactors across England and Wales.\nMinisters hope up to 24GW will come from this source by 2050 - representing about 25% of the UK's projected electricity demand. \nA new government body, Great British Nuclear, will be set up to bring forward new projects and a \u00a3120m Future Nuclear Enabling Fund will be set up this month. \nHowever, none of the reactors will be built in Scotland, which now only has one operational nuclear station - at Torness in East Lothian, which is due to close in 2028.\nMr Kwarteng told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the only way to decarbonise the UK's energy \"baseload\" was through use of nuclear energy, saying there was \"huge appetite\" for new projects in England and Wales.\nHe added: \"We have no plans to impose nuclear reactors in Scotland. It's a devolved affair, it's up to people in Edinburgh to decide what their nuclear policy is.\"\nMr Matheson told BBC Scotland the backbone of future energy supply should be offshore renewables, in particular wind farms.\nAnd he dismissed nuclear power as being risky and expensive, saying it would need to be subsidised heavily by taxpayers.\nHe said: \"Not only is there environmental risk associated with that, there is also the issue that this is likely to drive up the cost of household bills - whereas renewables such as wind and marine tidal in the future would actually reduce the cost of electricity. \n\"I think the UK government might have allowed themselves to be wrapped up in the nuclear lobby here.\"\nThe GMB Scotland union has backed nuclear energy, with senior organiser Drew Duffy saying it was was \"an absolute pipe dream that we could provide Scotland's energy needs on wind alone\".\nHe said: \"Yes there has to be renewables, wind is going to be part of an energy mix, but there are days when the wind doesn't blow. You could have a million wind farms, but if there's no wind they don't generate enough electricity to keep the lights on.\n\"Nuclear is green, it's safe, and it's continuous - you can have that as the baseline to make sure that the lights in Scotland stay on.\"\nNuclear power is licensed by the UK government, so there could only be new plants in Scotland with Westminster's approval.\nWhat Kwasi Kwarteng has also made clear is that Holyrood's say-so would also be required.\nNot only has the business secretary said he has no plans to \"impose\" new reactors, he's gone further by describing nuclear policy as a \"devolved affair\".\nThat approach may frustrate those in the UK government who wanted the energy security strategy to challenge the Scottish government's long-standing opposition to new nuclear.\nThe UK energy minister Greg Hands recently tried an alternative approach - appealing for a rethink in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nHowever, he seemed to accept that because planning powers are devolved it would be very difficult to proceed without Scottish government consent.\nAt Holyrood, the SNP, Greens and Liberal Democrats are against new nuclear, while the Conservatives and Labour are, like the GMB union, in favour.\nWithout new plants Scotland will have no nuclear power by 2028 except that which is drawn from England on the shared electricity grid on days when the wind is not blowing strongly.\nScottish and UK ministers are also at odds over the future of domestic oil and gas supplies, with the energy strategy calling for fresh licensing in the North Sea.\nMr Matheson said any new development of reserves in the North Sea would need to be compatible with climate change goals - and would not come quickly or cheaply.\nHe added: \"Even fossil fuels that come from Scottish waters are open to the vagaries of international markets. Oil and gas is an internationally-traded commodity, so if the prices go up internationally we can't insulate ourselves from that.\n\"That's why the objective is to move much more quickly towards renewables and energy efficiency.\"\nThe UK government said its commitment to more North Sea projects recognised \"the importance of these fuels to the transition and to energy security\", adding that producing gas in the UK had a lower carbon footprint than that imported from abroad.\nHowever, last month the government's climate advisers said UK-produced gas would be sold internationally and would barely reduce the consumer price.\nScottish Secretary Alister Jack said the plans would \"turbocharge energy production\" and the key to that would be accelerating the use of green technologies. \nHe added: \"We will also maximise oil and gas production in the North Sea, making the most of our existing assets and expertise. This will bolster domestic energy security while at the same time supporting Scottish jobs. \n\"Scotland will play a key role in achieving our ambitious energy security strategy, and we will work with the Scottish government to maximise our domestic energy supply.\"\nAlthough most aspects of energy policy are reserved to the UK parliament, planning is a devolved matter and therefore the Scottish ministers have the power to approve or reject new projects north of the border. \nDeirdre Michie, chief executive of industry trade body Offshore Energies UK, said \"energy security is now national security\".\nShe added: \"Many companies involved in UK oil and gas are already expanding into offshore wind, creating the infrastructure for mass hydrogen production, and building carbon capture and storage systems. They have the expertise not just in engineering but also in financing and managing these huge projects.\"\nFor offshore wind, the government said its new target would be to generate up to 50GW by 2030, more than enough to power every home in the UK.  \nFor onshore wind, the strategy only commits to consulting on developing partnerships with \"a limited number of supportive communities\" who wish to host wind turbines in return for lower energy bills. \nKeith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, said: \"Supercharging ambition on green energy security is to be welcomed - we have the projects and are ready to build them. \n\"It takes five times longer to get a project through the UK's planning system than to build it - that's got to change if we're to stand any chance of weaning our energy system off global gas and making a green future a reality.\"\nTargets for hydrogen production are also being doubled, with an ambition of increasing capacity to up to 10GW by 2030. \nUnder the new plans, up to 95% of the UK's electricity could come from low-carbon sources by 2030.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13B08/production/_123784608_gettyimages-976615340.jpg", "alt": "Torness power station"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/51BF/production/_122972902_gettyimages-538536811.jpg", "alt": "Nuclear station and wind turbine"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg", "alt": "Presentational grey line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4D31/production/_116316791_glenncampbell20_tr-nc.png", "alt": "Analysis box by Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland political editor"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg", "alt": "Presentational grey line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1580D/production/_123177088_gettyimages-1148474132.jpg", "alt": "north sea platform"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/93E0/production/_124065873_gettyimages-1278750170.jpg", "alt": "EDF energy offshore wind farm"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61023988", "page_details": [{"post_title": "NI Health: Belfast man in eight-month 'emergency' heart surgery wait"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 12:51:49"}, {"article_body": "A west Belfast man has been rushed to hospital after collapsing at home during an eight-month wait for emergency heart surgery. \nDamien McNulty, 40, has an aortic aneurysm - a bulge in the wall of the major blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the body. \nIt is potentially life-threatening.\nThe Belfast Trust said it wanted to \"sincerely apologise to Mr McNulty for the length of time he has had to wait for his surgery\".\nIn a statement, the trust added: \"We do not underestimate the anxiety and distress this may cause and we deeply regret this.\"\nMr McNulty's condition deteriorated in recent weeks and on Tuesday he woke up with a new symptom, a tightness across his chest. \nHis wife Marion said he then took a \"really bad turn\" in front of their three young children and an ambulance was called. \nShe said the medical team could not \"believe a man with an aneurysm that large was left at home untreated for so long\". \nMr McNulty was admitted to hospital and is now scheduled to have his surgery on Monday 11 April.\nSpeaking from his hospital bed to the Nolan Show on BBC Radio Ulster, Mr McNulty, a father-of-three, said he would \"not go down without a fight\".\nHis aneurysm was diagnosed five years ago and at that time he said he was advised it was no cause for concern.\nHowever new scans last summer revealed it had grown to the size of a golf ball and surgery was needed immediately. \nMrs McNulty said eight months passed and there was no date for the operation.\n\"He was a very healthy 40-year-old male, He worked full time and went to the gym most evenings,\" she said.\n\"Now, he has no weight on him.

And then from there I advertised what I was doing on Facebook and then local companies got in touch with me and they gave me skips and support.\n\"Since putting the CCTV up in the fly-tipping hot spots there haven't been any prosecutions as people have been deterred so there's been a drop in fly-tipping straight away.\"\nDaniel wants to expand his project and continue organising big group events to clear waste with local residents. \nMerthyr council said it was grateful to people helping to make the area \"a cleaner and greener place to live, work and visit\".\n\"Our street cleansing teams do a fantastic job, however littering and fly-tipping continues to be a national issue,\" said a council statement.\nOther winners include the youth organisation the Urdd, which won the special award on its centenary for helping people seeking refuge from Afghanistan and the Ukraine. \nIts residential centre in Cardiff Bay is being used to help up to 250 people from Ukraine and it has helped 100 children and families as part of the Afghan resettlement scheme. \nFormer gambling addict Jordan Lea from Llysfaen, Conwy county, won the business award.

But the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed up costs up even further.\nHowever, Mag Richards of the Welsh Anti Nuclear Alliance claimed the strategy's focus on nuclear power was likely to increase energy bills, not lower them.\n\"We are appalled by this huge lost opportunity to address the immediate problems being faced by consumers and the climate,\" she said.\n\"We need to act now by turning to renewables and energy storage not by adding extra taxes to already inflated energy bills to fund a technology that cannot deliver on time and will cost the earth.\"\nHigher targets for how much electricity is generated by offshore windfarms should lead to more being built off the coast of Wales.\n50GW worth - enough to power every home in the UK - is being aimed for by 2030 - with 5GW of that to come from new floating windfarms.\nSaurabh Shah of Falck Renewables, one of a number of companies working on plans for new windfarms in the Celtic Sea off Pembrokeshire, said new targets would help attract investors.\n\"There is a growth story here for Wales,\" he said.\n\"You start with these projects that will be among the first in the world at this stage and that will create future potential export opportunities.\"\nPlans to double the UK's low carbon hydrogen production capacity - as an alternative to gas and petrol - will also be welcomed in Milford Haven and on Anglesey where work is under way to develop hydrogen hubs.\nMinimal reference is made to the potential for tidal energy - apart from the government saying they will \"aggressively explore\" the potential opportunities.\nMinisters also say they will work with Welsh government and the energy regulator Ofgem to improve grid capacity in Wales.\nThis is considered a long-standing major issue - with parts of the network fully booked, making it impossible for communities wanting to add new renewable energy schemes to do so.\nWill Henson, energy policy lead at the Institute of Welsh Affairs, said the grid was not fit for purpose across Wales.\n\"We've reached a point of decision making about what we want our national grid to look like - because that's what's going to underpin a lot of Wales' ambitions to produce more energy through renewable sources.\n\"We need to be able to plug into that grid, it needs to be fit for our needs in Wales - and (the power to do that) is obviously held in London.\"\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DC57/production/_124070465_1649182144183.png", "alt": "Design of Rolls Royce's small modular reactor on Anglesey"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14E7C/production/_120782658_gettyimages-1084537548.jpg", "alt": "Wylfa on Anglesey"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4590/production/_124080871_pic.jpg", "alt": "Ken and Meriel Chippendale"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/93B0/production/_124080873_martin.jpg", "alt": "Martin and Vicky Platt"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/4AB7/production/_124072191_microsoftteams-image-45.png", "alt": "Cost of living data"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png", "alt": "2px presentational grey line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/174AF/production/_124070459_bluefloatenergy.jpg", "alt": "Floating wind farm"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-61022678", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Why many experts aren't impressed with the UK's energy plans"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 15:55:38"}, {"article_body": "Environmentalists and many energy experts have reacted with dismay at the failure of the government's energy security strategy to cut emissions and bills in the short term. They welcome the long-term target to secure low-carbon home-grown energy supplies.\nBut they say it does nothing new in the short-term to reduce bills, cut emissions or decrease dependency on imported gas. They accuse the document of perversely down-playing the fastest and cheapest ways of combating energy dependency - namely, energy efficiency, onshore wind and solar power.\nThere's wide agreement among environmentalists, energy experts and opposition parties that the UK needs a huge insulation programme to save houses leaking heat. But the document offers no new incentives for that\nA Downing Street source told me it was an energy supply strategy - not a demand strategy - even though experts point out that these are two sides of the same coin.\nEnergy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng agreed the strategy would do nothing in the short-term to help reduce bills. The document was for major decisions in the longer term, he told the BBC's Today programme.\nBut the Treasury is reported to have blocked a plan to offer more short-term incentives to insulate homes. The government wouldn't comment on that. \nCampaigners are also furious that ministers have committed to seeking more oil and gas in the North Sea - even though humans have already found enough fossil fuels to wreck the climate.\nMinisters argue that home-produced gas creates fewer emissions than imported gas compressed into tanks on ships. \nThis is widely accepted, but critics warn that as head of the UN's climate negotiations process, the UK has a responsibility to lead other nations away from fossil fuels.\nFracking is another contentious issue. After weeks of pressure from a small group of backbenchers the document opens a new inquiry into the process of smashing rocks underground to release trapped gas. \nBut it would take many more years of exploration to see if firms could obtain a worthwhile amount of gas - and it's likely to stir up local opposition as it did before. \nThere is also growing concern of so-called \"fugitive\" emissions - that's gas released accidentally into the atmosphere when the rocks crack.\nMeanwhile, the government's much-trailed resolve to increase offshore wind has been applauded by climate experts. They welcome the news that ministers will ease planning hold-ups.\nThere will be room, too, for more floating wind turbines to be used in deeper waters - and surplus energy from wind power will be used to boost the supply of hydrogen.\nOnshore wind has been more contentious. It's one of the cheapest forms of new energy - and one of the fastest to install. That means it could help with bills relatively quickly.\nBut some Cabinet ministers have fought off a bid by the business department to ease the uniquely strict planning rules for onshore wind. They say some local people strongly object - even though polls consistently show a large majority of the population is in favour.\nAs for the government's plans for nuclear power - which is now roughly twice as dear as wind and solar energy - there's still no solution to disposing of nuclear waste. Others deride government hopes for mini nuclear reactors, serving individual towns and cities, warning of security concerns and a public backlash.\nSome environmentalists say the nuclear price is worth paying to bolster the UK's climate law mandating near zero carbon emissions by 2050. Nuclear would ensure a proportion of the UK's electricity can be generated irrespective of the sun or wind. \nBut there's scepticism whether the small modular reactors liked by the government will be ready in time. Experts warn that several previous prime ministers have promised a nuclear revival and failed to deliver.\nThe document has supporters. The government's Climate Change Committee applauded the strategy for its commitment to supply low-carbon energy.\nIts director of analysis, Mike Thompson, said: \"The new commitments are hugely ambitious - they would see the UK produce more electricity from offshore wind in 2030 than it has produced from gas in any year in history. Government, business and industry will need to focus relentlessly on delivery at a scale and pace as yet unseen.\"\nBut the committee joined the chorus of annoyance at the absence of measures to cut demand. And others went further in their criticisms.\nHelen Clarkson, head of the non-profit Climate Group, said: \"This strategy is all about jam tomorrow when we need deep emissions cuts today. \n\"We have tools and technologies already available which can radically reduce our energy needs and our carbon emissions now. Energy efficiency measures - such as insulation - can deliver immediately. There's a huge opportunity for a win-win here, which the government is passing up.\"\nTessa Khan, from the climate campaign group Uplift, added: \"This strategy is a betrayal of the millions of families across the UK who are being pushed to the brink by energy bills caused by our reliance on gas. \n\"Instead of supporting them with a drive to insulate homes and boost our access to cheap, clean renewable energy, the government has sided with oil and gas companies, who offer no solutions to our energy affordability crisis.\n\"Right now we need a real plan to help people across the country access safe, affordable energy and instead the government has added fuel to the fire.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/138FB/production/_113332108_home-insulation.jpg", "alt": "A builder installing thermal roof insulation"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EFA3/production/_124074316_windfarm_pa_tv075052031.jpg", "alt": "Teesside Wind Farm"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13DC3/production/_124074318_hinkley_pa_tv054942626.jpg", "alt": "Construction of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-wales-61028886", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Bute Park murder: Cardiff student lied to protect killer"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 15:21:40"}, {"article_body": "A \"naive\" student in \"awe\" of a teenage girl jailed for murder was manipulated into lying to police to protect her, a court has been told.\nDionne Timms-Williams, 17, fatally attacked Dr Gary Jenkins in Bute Park, Cardiff, on 20 July 2021.\nCardiff Crown Court heard that Lewis Newman, 18, from Cardiff, falsely told detectives she had stayed at his home that night.\nNewman pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice.\nHe was sentenced to six months in a young offenders' institution, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work and pay a \u00a3128 victim surcharge. \nDr Jenkins, 56, a consultant psychiatrist and father-of-two, was \"cruelly beaten\" and \"tortured\" during a prolonged homophobic attack by Timms-Williams and two men.\nHe never regained consciousness and died in hospital 16 days later.\nTimms-Williams, who was 16 at the time, Jason Edwards, 26, and Lee Strickland, 36, all denied murder but were convicted after a trial and sentenced to life in prison last month.\nTimms-Williams will be expected to serve a minimum of 17 years before being eligible for parole.\nThe court was told Timms-Williams contacted Newman hours after the assault to ask if he would lie and say she had stayed with him that night should anyone ask.\nNewman claimed Timms-Williams was \"vague\" and only told him she had been involved in a \"serious incident\".\nAfter Timms-Williams was arrested, police contacted Newman, who was 17 at the time, and he recounted the lie.\nProsecutor Nicholas Gedge said: \"Initially, the investigation was not for murder because Dr Gary Jenkins didn't die until August 5.\n\"It started as an investigation into an attempted murder and robbery. And on July 28, following the arrest of Dionne Timms-Williams, Mr Newman provided a statement to South Wales Police.\n\"He said he had been with Miss Timms-Williams between around 5pm and 9pm on July 19 in the area around Maindy Leisure Centre. He said they parted company at about 9pm and that he went home and the next time he saw her was at his home address at 2am the next morning.\n\"He told police he had been sleeping at home and heard a knock on the door. On him opening the door, she asked if she could stay the night. The following morning, she thanked him for allowing her to stay the night and said she had made his bed for him.\"\nIn his statement to police, Newman gave the name of another friend of Timms-Williams and said he believed she visited her after leaving his house.\nTwo days later, when police officers interviewed the friend, she told them Timms-Williams had actually turned up at her house in the early hours and made incriminating statements about being with two homeless men and getting into \"a fight\" in Bute Park.\nSue Ferrier, defending Newman, said: \"He was a naive 17-year-old who had always been a shy, introverted, young man who didn't have a wide circle of friends.\n\"When he went to college, he was befriended, on the face of it, by Miss Timms-Williams and introduced to a wider group of friends.\n\"Perhaps, to an extent, he was in awe of this young woman. Perhaps he was a bit of an easy target.\n\"There was some misplaced loyalty from this young man, not realising at the time how serious the offence had been.\"\nMs Ferrier said Newman's statement did not divert police attention or change the course of the investigation.\nShe said her client had never been in trouble with the police before and his mental health had been severely affected.\n\"He was totally shocked as time past by the atrocities his friend was capable of. He was perhaps blinded by her. Perhaps many people were,\" Ms Ferrier said.\n\"He has bitter feelings of regret that he didn't tell the truth and he's genuinely remorseful for doing what he did.\"\nJudge Daniel Williams said: \"You had fallen out with her some time before and you say you were trying to make up with her by helping her out in this way.\n\"I am satisfied you were a young 17-year-old and could not believe she'd be involved in the assault.\n\"Miss Timms-Williams was younger than you but was more streetwise and, in this context, more manipulative.\"\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F224/production/_122988916_027ce644-d147-4d7f-88b4-e2660fd25f0d.jpg", "alt": "Dr Gary Jenkins"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9505/production/_123894183__123893519_mediaitem123893516.jpg", "alt": "Jason Edwards, Lee William Strickland, Dionne Timms-Williams"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-61027769", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Nottingham maternity crisis: Families write to Shropshire review midwife"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 15:20:23"}, {"article_body": "The woman who led the inquiry into the UK's biggest maternity scandal said she would be willing to hold a similar position into a probe in Nottingham.\nA review into failing maternity units at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH) was opened last year.\nFamilies of babies who died have criticised the pace of the review, and have written to Donna Ockenden, who led the inquiry in Shropshire.\nShe said any decision would be for the government to consider.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it was taking the concerns of families regarding NUH \"very seriously\".\nLast month a report into Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust said more than 200 babies may have died through failures in care over 20 years.\nAn independent review into NUH began in November last year, but calls have been made to upgrade the investigation to a full public inquiry.\nMs Ockenden, a senior midwife who led the review into Shropshire, told BBC Radio Shropshire she had been approached by concerned families in Nottingham.\nShe said she was \"deeply touched and honoured\" to receive their backing, but said it was not guaranteed she would be able to lead a new review.\n\"Clearly there would need to be an appointment process - it's not up to me to appoint myself of course,\" she said.\n\"I've responded [to the families] and said I'm deeply honoured.\n\"I would of course take on [and] chair that review, but there is a team in place at the moment, it's not my decision as to whether I take it on.\n\"I know that the families in Nottingham have said that they've written to the Secretary of State [Sajid Javid], so we can await the next steps.\"\nIn a statement a DHSC spokesperson said: \"We take the patient safety concerns at Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust's maternity services very seriously. \n\"The Trust is taking action to improve services but we are closely monitoring progress in improving the standard of care for mothers and babies.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Panning differences and devolved policies mean the strategy will be different for Scotland. So where does the country stand on the key points of the UK's blueprint?\nWestminster has announced it plans to reduce the UK's reliance on oil and gas by building as many as eight new nuclear reactors. \nHowever, the Scottish government has long been opposed to renewing traditional nuclear energy plants.\nPlanning powers are devolved, so any attempts to develop new sites could be blocked by Scottish ministers. \nThe Hunterston B plant in North Ayrshire was shut down in January, while the last station - at Torness in East Lothian - is due to close in 2028, two years earlier than planned.\nUK Energy Minister Greg Hands said in March it was a pity Scottish ministers were opposed to nuclear power, saying he hoped the Scottish government would change its mind. \nThe Scottish government's Energy Secretary, Michael Matheson, insisted: \"Our position is very clear on nuclear, we don't believe nuclear needs to be part of the future energy mix here in Scotland and we have got no intention of taking forward nuclear developments.\"\nThe UK Energy Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, confirmed there were \"no plans to impose nuclear reactors in Scotland\" in future.\nThe UK government aims to reform planning laws to speed up approvals for new offshore wind farms. \nThis was welcomed by Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power. He said: \"It takes five times longer to get a project through the UK's planning system than to build it - that's got to change if we're to stand any chance of weaning our energy system off global gas and making a green future a reality.\"\nRenewable and low carbon energy form the Scottish government's foundation for future energy systems. \nIt aims to produce 50 gigawatts (GW) of energy through offshore wind. \nIts ScotWind auction of seabed plots for major offshore projects netted \u00a3700m.\nThe 17 projects cover a total of 7,000km2 which have a combined potential generating capacity of 25GW.\nSteven Wheeler, managing director of SSE's renewables division, thinks the UK strategy will kickstart an infrastructure rollout across the UK.\nHe said: \"We have plans for the world's biggest offshore wind farm at Berwick bank at 4.2 GW. \n\"The challenge to get that over the line is to speed up the planning process. It has taken projects between eight to 10 years to go through the planning process and yet we can build a wind turbine in one day.\" \nFor onshore wind farms the UK government wants to develop partnerships with \"supportive communities\" who want to host turbines in exchange for guaranteed cheaper energy bills. \nUK targets for hydrogen production are being doubled to help provide cleaner energy for industry as well as for power, transport and potentially heating.\nIn November, the Scottish government launched a \u00a3100m, five-year plan to build Scotland's hydrogen economy.\nIts ambition is for the technology to provide nearly a sixth of Scotland's energy needs by 2030.\nThe Scottish government's Energy Transition Fund was also expanded to invest \u00a315m in an Aberdeen Hydrogen Hub which will develop on-the-ground infrastructure to support the growth of a hydrogen transport fleet and the deployment of new applications across the north east.\nOil giant BP has joined the project which hopes to create hundreds of jobs. \nThe Aberdeen Hydrogen Hub is to have a solar power facility connected to a green hydrogen production and refuelling facility.\nGreen hydrogen refers to when the gas is produced from renewable energy as opposed to methods that release greenhouse emissions. \nThe latest Scottish government figures show at least 70,000 solar installations in Scotland in 2020.\nHome Energy Scotland estimates an average three-bedroomed house in central Scotland would save \u00a3450 a year under current higher energy prices, and the cost would be paid back in 15 years.\nHouseholders are currently waiting for up to a year to have them fitted with interest-free loans from Home Energy Scotland on offer\nThe UK government strategy has committed to more North Sea oil and gas projects. The government said it recognised \"the importance of these fuels to the transition and to energy security\".\nIt said producing gas in the UK has a lower carbon footprint than that imported from abroad.\nBut climate advisers said UK-produced gas would be sold internationally and would barely reduce the consumer price.\nAccording to the Climate Change Committee, new fossil fuel projects in the North Sea would, in some cases, not deliver gas until 2050.\nFriends of the Earth Scotland had previously called on the government to reject all new oil and gas projects due to the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels.\nThe Scottish government expects a further leasing round on oil and gas from the UK government.\nMichael Matheson agreed these would continue to be an important part of the energy mix but said: \"We need to accelerate our decarbonisation, our reliance on fossil fuel such as oil and gas.\"\nHe said the energy systems of the future would focus on offshore renewable potential and moving towards that through Scottish government policies including ScotWind would deliver that.\nMr Matheson added that it was the Scottish government's position that any new oil and gas reserves would need to be compatible with net zero objectives.\nThe UK government has promised a \u00a330m \"heat pump investment accelerator competition\" to make British heat pumps.\nHeat pumps can replace household gas systems but are expensive to fit.\nWhile householders in England and Wales will be able to apply for a \u00a35,000 grant from April, a cashback scheme worth \u00a37,500 is already in place in Scotland.\nBut the profitable Renewable Heat Incentive, which paid homeowners based on how much heating they produced, recently ended with the financial year.\nThe potential savings have grown to \u00a3261 per year, compared with just \u00a343 per year under the previous price cap.\nFor those replacing an oil-fired system, the savings could be as high as \u00a3607 per year.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16FE1/production/_124077149_gettyimages-499135195.jpg", "alt": "nuclear power station"}, {"src":

from other countries or connected to the slave trade among its collections.\nSome are on display in a new exhibition called Inclusive Global Histories.\nRepresentatives from ethnic minority organisations helped set it up and provided advice.\nThe museum has about 4,500 items collected from Asia, Africa, America and Oceania in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\nSome other museums are examining potential links to the slave trade or whether they have items stolen, looted or removed by the British during the period of empire.\nSome have received requests for items to be returned from Australia, Asia and South America. \nAccording to the curator of modern history at National Museums NI, Tr\u00edona White Hamilton, many of the artefacts from other cultures were collected by the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society and then donated to the Ulster Museum in 1910.\n\"There's only a limited amount of records that come with the collections,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"People collected things for all sorts of reasons - they were curious about other cultures around the world, some had deep appreciation for the life and skills of indigenous cultures.\n\"But there's also evidence that there were items that were collected unethically as well.\n\"The items in the world cultures collection really reflect the Western collectors that collected them at that time.\"\nMs White Hamilton said that the Ulster Museum has begun to trace the provenance of some of those items.\n\"There are objects in the exhibition that we know from our records were stolen or looted from different countries around the world,\" she said.\n\"For example we have a spear that was taken from Benin in 1897 by a British expedition there.\n\"It's one of three spears that we hold here in National Museums Northern Ireland, but we're working with a project called Digital Benin to digitise and research those collections.\"\nThe colonial occupation of the Kingdom of Benin - now Edo State, Nigeria - by British troops in February 1897 led to a worldwide dispersal of an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 objects collectively called the \"Benin bronzes\", which were plundered from the Royal Palace and other ceremonial sites there.\nDigital Benin is a website digitally reassembling the collection, but Ms White Hamilton said the museum was \"involved in discussions about whether or not the spear should be housed in the Ulster Museum or should it belong somewhere else\".\nAnother item in the exhibition - a bronze manilla or bracelet from West Africa - was used as currency in the slave trade.\nOnly a small number of the museum's 4,500 artefacts from other cultures are on display in Inclusive Global Histories.\nHowever, National Museums NI has worked with groups representing ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland and in places like Australia and Chile on the exhibition.\n\"We're also working with local marginalised groups here, for example the African-Caribbean Support Organisation for Northern Ireland, and having similar discussions with them about whether or not these items that have been collected unethically really should be in the museum collections,\" Ms White Hamilton said.\nA charred beam from a recent arson attack on the Belfast Multi-Cultural Association (BMCA) building is one of the contemporary exhibits.\nKhaled El Fotooh from BMCA was one of those who advised the museum on the content of the exhibition.\n\"That building was the main hub to provide numerous things to the public - we had a food bank in there, we gave out furniture, we had a clothes bank as well,\" he said.\nHe said that the exhibition showed a changing Northern Ireland.\n\"The world is generally becoming a more diverse place for everybody so it's good to know that Belfast tomorrow will be a better Belfast than it is today and will continue to be a better place for the future,\" he added.\n\"Different ethnic minorities have a footprint here in Northern Ireland and their organisations are growing.\n\"They are contributing to Northern Ireland, so it would be great to have a space in the museum to showcase the history and the heritage of those people who are active citizens in the society of Northern Ireland.\"\nMr El Fotooh said that he was undecided over whether some of the museum's artefacts should be repatriated.\n\"I think it's beautiful to walk into any museum anywhere in the world and find artefacts from different places in the world,\" he said.\n\"If the museum contains just artefacts of the homeland or home town it might have all a similar theme and the colours might all be the same.\n\"We go into museums to try to figure out past nations, how they lived, and understand different cultures.\"\nTr\u00edona White Hamilton said that the Inclusive Global Histories exhibition was just the start of the museum's work to examine the colonial origins of some of its collections.\n\"There is a lot of work still to be done to find out how those items were collected in the first place,\" she said.\n\"That's not something that we can just do locally, we need the support and partnership of organisations internationally to do that type of research as well.\"\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12238/production/_124069247_itemspear.jpg", "alt": "Ulster Museum display of artefacts including spear it says

{"article_body": "The Welsh Conservatives have promised to tackle \"bread and butter issues\" as they launched their local election campaign on Thursday.\nAt an event in Llandudno, party Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies announced the Tories are fielding their highest number of candidates - 669 - on 5 May.\nThey were the biggest gainers in the previous Welsh local elections, in 2017, and have more to defend now.\nFive years ago the Conservatives took majority control of Monmouthshire.\nThey have cabinet members in ruling coalitions in Powys, Wrexham and Conwy as well as Denbighshire, where they became the largest group in 2017.\nThey also became the biggest group of councillors in Vale of Glamorgan, leading the authority for two years. \nBut Labour returned to power there in 2019, as head of a coalition, after internal rows resulted in eight councillors, including six cabinet members, quitting the Tory group.\nIn the 2017 local elections, the Conservatives increased their number of councillors across 12 of Wales' 22 authorities, including notably better performances in Cardiff and Bridgend and raising their total number of Welsh council seats by 80 to 184. \nAt Thursday's local election campaign launch, Mr Davies said Conservatives running councils offer a \"quality service, addressing those bread and butter issues of fixing the streetlights, fixing the pavements, putting the potholes right\".\n\"What some people might laugh at as trivial things are big issues for many people when they step outside their front door,\" he said.\n\"We will deliver for people, as we always have, in local government.\"\nMr Davies said Wales simply could not afford \"another lost five years in local government\".\n\"I drove up from south Wales today, I see communities brimming with opportunity, brimming with optimism, wanting that unleashing of that potential that has been held back by Plaid, Labour and liberals in Cardiff Bay,\" he said.\n\"Let's make the difference,\" Mr Davies told Tory activists.\nWhatever the issues are in their patch, you can rarely divorce local parties' electoral fortunes from the bigger political story across the UK.\nHow voters might see Boris Johnson's prime ministership in relation to the cost of living crisis, the war in Ukraine and the continuing developments over Westminster parties held during Covid restrictions could be crucial. \nThe leader of Conservative Monmouthshire council even called for Mr Johnson to resign, a few months ago.\nBut Andrew RT Davies said the Conservatives were \"vibrant\" with \"solutions to the challenges that people face on a day-to-day basis\".\nPraising Boris Johnson's premiership, he said the prime minister was \"answering the big questions\".\nThis included responding to the Covid pandemic with a vaccination programme, \"standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our Ukrainian friends in the face of the abhorrent aggression\" and raising the national threshold while cutting fuel duty to help with the cost of living, he insisted.\nOpening the event, Conservative Wales Office Minister David TC Davies said that in these local elections his party was standing for \"values that have always been the cornerstone\" of its policies \"in every level of government\". \n\"We're going to be standing for freedom, prosperity and security, and we've got four weeks to go,\" to election day, he said.\nThe minister urged the party faithful to\"get out there onto the doorsteps\" and show the people of Wales that the party's 2019 general election success, in which it captured six seat from Labour was \"not just a one off\".\nThe Conservative Party, he said, was \"winning the arguments, winning seats and ready to take control of local authorities in Wales\".\nWales will be electing councillors in each of its 22 local authorities next month.\nThere are also elections taking place in parts of England, in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nCouncil elections are an opportunity for voters to decide who should run their local services, and as they look to build on the gains they made five years ago, the Welsh Conservatives are keen to remind people of that fact.\nBut they'll also be well aware that their fate next month is likely to be decided by how people feel about wider issues, including lockdown parties in Downing Street and the cost of living crisis.\nEarlier this week the Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said people \"had moved on\" from party-gate. \nWe'll get a better idea of how true that is in four weeks' time.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

court he was killed by his stepfather and a teenage boy.\nAngharad Williamson, 31, John Cole, 40, and the boy, 14, are all accused of the murder of five-year-old Logan Mwangi.\nLogan's body was found in the River Ogmore in Sarn, Bridgend county, on 31 July 2021.\nWhen asked by Caroline Rees QC, prosecuting, who killed Logan, Ms Williamson told Cardiff Crown Court: \"John Cole and [the youth].\"\nWhen asked if she has seen or heard the attack, Ms Williamson said she did not because she was asleep. \nDuring cross examination from the youth's barrister, John Hipkin QC, Ms Williamson said she \"never thought [the youth] would kill Logan\".\nRegarding an alleged attack on Logan two days before he died by Cole and the youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons due to his age, Ms Williamson said the 14-year-old \"had done what John Cole had told him to do\".\nMs Williamson also admitted to lying to police about a very serious injury to Logan's arm, saying she did so in order to protect her partner.\n\"How my son was battered to death has nothing to do with a dislocated arm months before,\" she added.\nWhile being cross examined by the prosecution about Logan's injuries, Ms Williamson looked towards the dock and said: \"I beg you Jay [John Cole] tell the truth, please.\"\nShe added that she should have left Cole \"months ago\" and \"should have grown a backbone\".\nWhen asked why the light came on in Logan's bedroom while her partner and the youth were out disposing of the five-year-old's body in the early hours, she said: \"I don't know - I wasn't awake\". \nShe also denied using her mobile phone during the night to access her banking app and to watch YouTube videos. \nSpeaking of the condition of Logan's room, where he spent the last 10 days of his life isolating with Covid-19, Ms Williamson said \"it was like a dungeon, because it was so dark in there\". \nAsked why she didn't let Logan outside, she said: \"I don't want to answer that... Jay [John Cole] didn't want him to.\n\"I was petrified of of Covid, of my children catching Covid and dying.\"\nShe told the court she had been a terrible mother and did not \"even feel like a mother any more\".\nMs Williamson, Cole and the 14-year-old deny murder.  \nCole has admitted perverting the course of justice after dumping Logan's body in a sports bag next to the river, which Ms Williamson and the youth both deny.\nThe two adults have also pleaded not guilty to causing or allowing the death of a child.\nThe trial continues.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E167/production/_123130775_c67a369e-06fd-4223-8bab-6c71d4ad5d7c.jpg", "alt": "Logan Mwangi, also known as Logan Williamson"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2B58/production/_124069011_2.66246050.jpg", "alt": "Court artist sketch of Angharad Williamson"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86CE/production/_119801543_mediaitem119801541.jpg", "alt": "Angharad Williamson and John Cole"}]}]}]}]}
