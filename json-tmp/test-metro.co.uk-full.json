He entered Cator Park shortly after 8pm and lay in wait for half-an-hour before Sabina arrived en route to The Depot bar where she was due to meet a friend.\nMs Morgan said it was \u2018out of character\u2019 for the year one Rushey Green Primary School teacher to be walking through the park after dark, but \u2018she was running late and this was the quickest route to get to the bar\u2019. \nShe was \u2018oblivious\u2019 to her killer as he ran up behind her and attacked her on the path near a park bench.\nThe Old Bailey was told Sabina suffered approximately 34 bows to the head, inflicted with such force that pieces of the sign broke off.\u00a0\nSelamaj\u2019s actions afterwards were out of camera shot, but Sabina was not seen alive again.\nMs Morgan said the defendant asphyxiated her and removed her tights and underwear before trying to cover her body in grass. \nThe prosecution allege there was a sexual motive for killing Sabina, even though there was no \u2018positive\u2019 evidence of a sexual assault.\nSabina\u2019s body was discovered by a dog walker the next day who  at first thought he was seeing a \u2018potato sack\u2019.\nSupporters from the Sabina Project outside the Old Bailey, central London (Picture: PA)Her death led to an outpouring of grief across the nation and led to renewed fury over violence against women in the UK.\nSabina\u2019s family said their world had been \u2018shattered into tiny pieces\u2019 following her murder. \nSister Jebina Yasmin Islam said in an impact statement read out in court: \u2018Our sister\u00a0Sabina\u00a0was way more than just a sister, a daughter, a teacher, she was a life.\n\u2018A life that didn\u2019t deserve to be taken.\n\u2018You snatched her without a second thought.\n\u2018You are not a human, you are a disgusting animal.\n\u2018Our parents are petrified any time one of their girls steps out the house now.\nMore: Crime newsTruly horrifying image shows swastika scratched on corpse of Ukraine rape victim\nWoman who felt threatened on bus got help by dialling 999 and asking for pizza\nTeacher who bombarded schoolboy with sexual WhatsApp messages is spared jail\u2018In our heads we have these images of what happened and what our sister must have felt when you decided to run after her and attack her when clearly she could not defend herself.\n\u2018You planned this and made sure she was alone.\n\u2018What makes us angry is that you left our sister\u2019s body in an unrespectable manner to fulfil your filthy desires.\n\u2018We just want answers as to why you killed her.\nKoci Selamaj has been handed a life sentence  (Picture: PA)\u2018Why?\n\u2018Our family will never forget what you did bit we will not let you take anymore from us.\u2019\nSelamaj had no previous convictions and no Interpol notices before he murdered Sabina.  But the sentencing hearing heard that the killer had a \u2018recent history of violent behaviour towards his ex-wife\u2019 Ionela Ghergishan, including putting his hands around her neck.\nMs Ghergishan said his behaviour towards her changed from May 2021 onwards, when he became \u2018controlling, coercive and physically aggressive\u2019.\nShe said she left him because she started to \u2018fear for her life\u2019, but on the day he killed Sabina, he had got in touch with her to pressure her for sex. \nThe prosecution say Selamaj\u2019s previous violent behaviour should be considered as an \u2018aggravated factor\u2019 in deciding his prison term, as well as his attempt to conceal the body. \nMs Morgan also alleges the attack \u2018did not come about on the spur of the moment\u2019 and there was \u2018significant planning\u2019. \nThree days before the killing, Selamaj booked a room at the five-star Grand Hotel in Eastbourne, the town where he already had accommodation.\nHis reservation was for the night of September 17 and he arrived earlier in the day to check in. \nMembers of the public attend a vigil in memory of Sabina Nessa and in solidarity against violence against women (Picture: PA)Sabina\u2019 death sparked calls for more to be done to keep women safe (Picture: PA)Before leaving the park, he picked up pieces of the warning triangle and used wet wipes to clean a  bench near to where he launched his initial attack.\nEn route back to the south coast, Selamaj stopped in Tunbridge Wells in Kent and dumped the warning triangle in the River Teise.\nSelamaj arrived back at The Grand Hotel at midnight and checked out in the morning before going to work at an Esso garage in Lewes.\nHe was arrested in the seaside town and charged days later.\nHe refused to comment in police interviews but when he was charged, the Albanian national said: \u2018What will happen if I open up now and say everything.\u2019\nMr Justice Sweeney said the \u2018inevitable\u2019 sentence would be life in prison, with a starting point of 30 years.\nHe adjourned the sentencing until 10am on Friday.\nMore: Crime newsTruly horrifying image shows swastika scratched on corpse of Ukraine rape victim\nWoman who felt threatened on bus got help by dialling 999 and asking for pizza\nTeacher who bombarded schoolboy with sexual WhatsApp messages is spared jailAddressing Selamaj, Sabina\u2019s mother and father said: \u2018As a parent, you would never have thought your child would die before you.

You are not a human being, you are an animal.\u2019\nSabina\u2019s death came months after the murder of Sarah Everard, sparking further calls for more to be done to make communities safer for women. \nLisa Williams, head teacher of the school she worked at, described the \u2018devastating\u2019 impact of her murder on staff and pupils. \nShe said Sabina was \u2018a happy, hard-working\u2019  teacher who had a \u2018fulfilling career ahead of her\u2019.\nOn Ms Nessa\u2019s class of 30 students, she said: \u2018For the rest of their lives, these young children will never be able to comprehend why someone murdered their teacher and the world in which they live is not safe for them to play in a\u00a0park.\u2019\nGot a story?

The Liverpool fan, known as Sasha, transported aid to remote areas and collected orders for medicine which he passed to other volunteers.\nThe last texts he sent to his sister read, \u2018they took mum\u2019, before a final message assuring her: \u2018Lena, we are fine, the phone will be turned off.\u2019\nThe family had rallied behind humanitarian work from the outset of the invasion, remaining with their fellow residents as Russian forces attempted to advance on Kyiv from the north and west.\nOn February 27, the occupying troops took control of the village and are first said to have taken Alexander\u2019s car before returning for his parents. \nElena pleaded with her brother to leave but he remained at their home, telling her he was waiting for the couple to return.\nAlexander Sukhenko excelled for his football club which wants to help trace and punish those responsible for his death (Picture: FC Kudrivka/@Kudrivka)The trio\u2019s bodies were found dumped in a shallow pit just outside the village on Saturday, two weeks after they went missing, as Russian troops withdrew from the northern approaches to the capital.\nThey are said by Ukrainian officials and media channels to have been tortured and murdered by Moscow\u2019s forces.\n\u2018My parents and brother laid down their lives for our village, for our country,\u2019 Elena said. \u2018They did not give up, did not break, did not let down the honour and name of our family.\n\u2018They are heroes.

He was helped by some friends to gather information on the safest routes. \n\u2018He and his mother and dad continued to help people leave every day. \n\u2018They also distributed products to local residents, providing support and solving urgent problems within their capabilities.\u2019\nAs Russian troops, including paratroopers and special forces, attempted to advance on the capital, the security situation in the village became increasingly perilous.

On the first day there were victims \u2013 innocent people.\n\u2018There were constant explosions under which they woke up and fell asleep. The light was gone and it was scary to go outside during the day. \n\u2018Gunshots were heard everywhere. But it didn\u2019t scare him for a second. \n\u2018He just said that my husband and I should have a Plan B, and that it would be better if we leave the village.

He had tried to speak to the occupiers, despite Elena warning him of the danger.\n\u2018He said that if you speak to them confidently and adequately, then everything will be the norm,\u2019 she said. \n\u2018I told them it was dangerous for them to stay home. But my parents and brother may have thought that they were no longer in much danger. \n\u2018How wrong they were.\u2019\nThe soldiers, who are reported to have searched the house and also taken a phone, then returned a few hours later and took the parents.\n\u2018First of all, they took our mother as the head of the village and as usual my dad went with her,\u2019 Elena said. \n\u2018Sasha called me the last time and said that they had promised to bring them back alive and he would wait for them.\n\u2018I asked if he should be somewhere else, I was very worried about him.\u2019\nAt 15.36 she received the final text from her brother saying, \u2018we are fine\u2019 but that his phone would be switched off.\nAlexander Sukhenko has been remembered for staying in his village to the last during the Russian occupation (Picture: Facebook/@boryspilTV)\u00a0In the following days, villagers turned to social media as they made a desperate appeal for information about the trio\u2019s whereabouts.\n\u2018I fought to the last to save them, I knocked on all the doors, I screamed and asked for help,\u2019 Elena said.\n\u2018But what happened to my family you can see for yourself. These damned Russian bastards took everything from me, my sense, my happy life.\u2019\nAlexander played for the regional football club FC Kudrivka, which shared Elena\u2019s account of her family\u2019s final hours. \nOleksandr Bruy, of the club\u2019s press service, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Alexander and his parents are heroes.
