government issued a plea for \u201cweapons, weapons, weapons\u201d.\n The Cabinet minister stressed that the UK was responding to the call to supply more military hardware to Ukraine to defeat Vladimir Putin\u2019s barbaric invasion.\n Speaking at a Nato meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: \u201cIn the face of Putin\u2019s appalling aggression in Ukraine, the G7 and Nato are stepping up our efforts on sanctions and on weapons.\n \u201cThe UK is now banning all imports of Russian energy, we are sanctioning more banks and we are stepping up our supply of weapons to Ukraine.\u201d\n Britain is set to send protected mobility vehicles to Ukraine, having already supplied thousands of missiles, including anti-tank weapons.\n A Ukrainian military delegation, led by Deputy Defence Minister Volodymyr Havrylov, visited the Salisbury Plain training area earlier this week and was shown the armoured vehicles, as well as loitering munitions, which hang in the air and can then be later deployed against a target, and the high-speed Starstreak missile system which has already been sent to Ukraine.\n It comes after Ukraine on Thursday issued three pleas to Nato members to defeat Vladimir Putin\u2019s barbaric invasion: \u201cWeapons, weapons, weapons\u201d.\n Ahead of the high-level talks in Brussels, the country\u2019s foreign minister stressed more military equipment was vital to prevent \u201cenormous sacrifices\u201d and \u201cmore Buchas\u201d, the town near Kyiv where Russian forces are accused of killing more than 300 civilians in war crimes which included executions, mass graves and rapes.\n Dmytro Kuleba urged countries in the West to \u201cput aside their hesitations, their reluctance\u201d and to supply more arms, stressing that \u201cas weird as it may sound today weapons serve the purpose of peace\u201d.\n Issuing his appeal, he said: \u201cMy agenda is very simple, it has only three items on it.\n \u201cIt\u2019s weapons, weapons and weapons.\n \u201cWe are confident that the best way to help Ukraine now is to provide it will all necessary to contain Putin and to defeat the Russian army in Ukraine so that the war does not spill over.\u201d\n He stressed that the Ukrainian army and nation had shown the world that \u201cwe know how to fight\u201d and \u201chow to win\u201d against the Russian president\u2019s troops.\n \u201cBut without sustainable and sufficient supplies of all weapons requested by Ukraine, these wins will be accompanied with enormous sacrifices,\u201d he added.\n \u201cThe more weapons we get and the sooner they arrive in Ukraine, the more human lives will be saved, the more cities and villages will not be destructed and there will be no more Buchas.\n \u201cI call on all allies to put aside their hesitations, their reluctance, to provide Ukraine with everything it needs because as weird as it may sound but today weapons serve the purpose of peace.\u201d\n Mr Kuleba stressed that Ukraine\u2019s military needs planes, heavy air defence system, and missiles vehicles from Nato members.\n The alliance is not itself providing any weapons, amid concerns that if it did this could allow Mr Putin to seek to escalate the conflict into one between Nato and Russia, so military equipment is being provided by individual nations in bilateral arrangements, even if co-ordinated between allies.\n Britain has provided thousands of missiles, including anti-tank weapons, and is reported to be considering sending armoured vehicles which would allow Ukrainian troops to advance with better protection closer towards Russian-occupied territory.\n The Czech government is reported to have been sending Soviet era tanks which Ukrainian forces are trained in using.\n The US has already provided more than $2.3 billion (\u00a31.7 billion) of lethal assistance to Ukraine since January 2021, including a a $100 million (\u00a376 million) transfer of Javelin anti-armour missiles announced days ago, and was also reported to be training Ukrainian forces in the use of military drones.\n Meanwhile, a fifth round of European Union sanctions on Russia, including a ban on coal imports, could be agreed by the bloc on Thursday or on Friday, the EU\u2019s top diplomat Josep Borrell said.\n \u201cMaybe this afternoon, or tomorrow at the latest,\u201d he said as he arrived at the Nato meeting.\n Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who was attending the summit, announced on Wednesday that the UK was freezing the assets of Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest bank, and Credit Bank of Moscow, banning all new investment in Russia and targeting eight more oligarchs.\n The move came after Boris Johnson said the actions of Russian forces in Ukraine appeared close to \u201cgenocide\u201d.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/03/18/urnpublicidap.orga1c4ef554b004afe920e57375b842311.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Russia has

We've had non domicile status for more than 200 years. \n \"And that means that on UK income, you pay taxes here in the UK, and on foreign income, you pay taxes abroad. That's something that's been well established. \n \u201cThe Chancellor has been very transparent about this. It's always been in this declaration of interests. \n \"I think there's a lot of malicious attacks on someone who is a private citizen and is not a politician.\"\n The news comes as Mr Sunak hiked National Insurance contributions by an extra 1.25p in the pound.\n From this week millions of employees and businesses will pay more tax as the country faces a cost of living crisis, with increasing energy and food bills and rising inflation. \n Ms Murthy, a fashion designer who married Mr Sunak in 2009, was born in India and holds Indian citizenship. The country does not allow its nationals to hold dual citizenship. \n She said she pays all the tax that she is legally required to in the UK.\n Ms Murthy\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cAkshata Murthy is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents\u2019 home. \n \u201cIndia does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously.\u201d\n Ms Murthy has lived in the UK for nine years and will automatically be deemed domiciled after six more, meaning she will have to begin paying taxes on all her income. \n Her billionaire father N.R Narayana Murthy founded the IT services company, Infosys, which is one of India's biggest firms. Ms Murthy, 42, is reported to own a little under 1 per cent of the shares of Infosys, which are said to have a value of more than \u00a3500m. \n She will have have received more than \u00a311 million in dividends from the company in the past tax year. But her non-dom tax status means she would not have had to pay UK tax on the dividend at a rate of 38.1 per cent.\n Ms Murthy also has interests in several companies in the UK. \n Last month Digme Fitness, a London boutique Ms Murthy had invested in and was a director of, collapsed leaving the taxpayer to pick up its debts of \u00a3415,000. Ms Murthy owned less than five per cent of the company.\n The collapse of the company came after it received up to \u00a3635,000 in furlough payments for staff during the pandemic. \n Mr Kwarteng said he was \u201ccompletely comfortable\u201d with Ms Murthy\u2019s business dealings. \n \"I'm totally comfortable with people having businesses, people operating what they do as private citizens, I'm completely comfortable about that,\u201d he told Sky News.\n \"I'm not an expert on her financial arrangements but I think absolutely people have a right to pursue their own business arrangements.\u201d \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/09/09e73492a9ce64b480868a95c225375bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5NDA3NzY1-2.66247047.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Sunak\u2019s family accused of \u2018sheltering\u2019 from UK tax with wife\u2019s non-dom status"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/19/f5e12200c1a625306ad5c51bdf219747Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzU2Mjc4-2.65196272.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Labour calls on Rishi Sunak to explain wife\u2019s non-dom tax status"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/12/2ca1b818b885d8a1c7714f4946325df5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzMwNDcz-2.66244964.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Johnson says putting up tax to fund NHS is \u2018unquestionably right\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/24/15/%C4%B0STANBUL%201.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Why your next break should be to Istanbul"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/uk/bbc-defeated-in-effort-to-name-mi5-source-b992998.html?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=homepage_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=3", "page_details": [{"post_title": "BBC banned from naming \u2018dangerous extremist and misogynist\u2019 as MI5 source"}, {"author_container": "By    Tristan Kirk Courts Correspondent @kirkkorner 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 09:57:37"}, {"article_body": "The BBC has been blocked from naming a \u201cdangerous extremist\u201d suspected of supplying information to MI5 who allegedly physically and emotionally abused two female partners.\n The broadcaster fought a High Court battle against Attorney General Suella Braverman over the story, insisting it is in the public interest to identify the Secret Service\u2019s source.\n Ms Braverman argued that if the BBC named the man it would damage national security and create \u201ca real and immediate risk of serious or life-threatening harm\u201d to him.\n The proposed report would claim the man used his status as an agent, or covert human intelligence source (Chis), to abuse, control and coerce a former partner, referred to by the pseudonym Beth, and that MI5 either knew or ought to have known about this and that it was wrong to use him as an agent.\n In a ruling on Thursday, Mr Justice Chamberlain approved an interim injunction to stop the allegations from being aired on national security grounds.\n The judge said: \u201cThe information about X\u2019s identity, in the context of the allegation that he is a Chis who works or worked for MI5, is \u2013 as the BBC accepts \u2013 confidential.\n \u201cAlthough X is said to have disclosed it to Beth (his former partner), and she disclosed it to the BBC, it is not known other than to a small group of individuals.\n \u201cThe attorney has satisfied me that, if it were to become publicly or widely known, there would be a real and immediate risk that X would be killed or seriously injured.\n \u201cIn order to address that risk, extensive protective measures would have to be, and would be, taken.\n \u201cAs a result of those measures, public disclosure of X\u2019s identity would have no significant protective effect on women considering entering into a relationship or liaison with X.\n \u201cWhilst including X\u2019s name and image would make the BBC\u2019s story more engaging and potentially more attractive to a wider audience, this would come at the expense of material damage to the effectiveness of the work of the security and intelligence agencies and, therefore, the national security of the UK.\u201d\n The legal battle has played out partially in secret due to the confidential and classified information involved. But the judge had revealed the basis for the dispute in an earlier ruling, allowing publicity to correct misinformation that had been leaked from within the government.\n Making his decision, the judge said the name and image of X would be blocked from publication, while other aspects of his identity may also be included in the interim injunction.\n The government said during the dispute that it does not object to the BBC making allegations about a source\u2019s behaviour, but believes naming the man known as X was wrong.\n In a statement issued after the ruling, the BBC said the judgment did not prevent it from reporting \u201ckey elements\u201d of its story once restrictions are determined.\n A spokesperson for the broadcaster said: \u201cThis is not the judgment we had hoped for, but it is important to understand what it does and does not mean.\n \u201cWhile the judgment prevents the BBC from identifying X, by showing his picture or naming him, it does not prevent the BBC from reporting key elements of the story, which we will do once the precise restrictions are determined.\n \u201cWe expect these restrictions to be clarified next week.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/10/183ab7f13dc168d32cd81ee3d133a76eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5NDEwMTQ4-2.49757492.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "BBC blocked by High Court from reporting identity of \u2018MI5 informant\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/02/f323fcce097589ace337769f0c5f20ffY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzUzMTY5-2.22581002.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "High Court to rule on bid for injunction to block BBC story over \u2018MI5 informant\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/10/0300ce1b9804b0f846c59058f710b9cfY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5NDEwNzU4-2.65896959.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "UK households \u2018face record \u00a3900 income hit this year\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/08/09/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "3 housing developments property hunters should know about"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/london-tube-underground-passenger-numbers-covid-pandemic-b992997.html?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=homepage_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=4", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Easter holiday rush sends Tube passenger numbers close to pre-pandemic levels"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 09:57:41"}, {"article_body": "The start of the Easter holidays took Tube passengers numbers to their highest rate for more than two years, it can be revealed.\n The number of journeys on the London Underground last Sunday hit 87 per cent of \u201cnormal\u201d pre-pandemic levels, equating to 1.72m trips.\n Bus passenger numbers on Sunday reached 83 per cent of levels seen in 2019, while both the Tube and bus networks recorded 80 per cent on the Saturday, according to the Department for Transport.\n Transport for London believes the spike may have been driven by Londoners heading off on holiday or visiting relatives. Sunday also saw Tottenham and West Ham home games.\n However weekday Tube figures remain typically stuck at between 60 to 67 per cent of previous levels \u2013 showing how many Londoners continue to work from home but are increasingly getting out at weekends.\n Monday\u2019s Tube journeys were at 59 per cent of normal, equating to 2.21m trips, with 72 per cent on the buses (3.91m journeys).\n This increased on Tuesday to 63 per cent on the Tube (2.48m journeys) and 74 per cent on the buses (4.16m journeys).\n Wednesday\u2019s figures were 65 per cent on the Tube (2.57m journeys) and 72 per cent on the buses (4.08m journeys).\n Transport for London modelling now indicates that \u201chybrid\u201d working could mean it will take until 2026 before overall demand reaches 96 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, according to evidence given to a House of Lords inquiry.\n National rail journeys fell back to 70 per cent on Monday, having been at 79 per cent two weeks earlier - likely to be a consequence of the start of the two-week school holidays.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/05/07/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Easter weekend Tube chaos as TfL announces widespread closures"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/12/09_Jan_JS_London_54.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "24-hour Tube strikes cost TfL \u00a313 million in lost fares"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/23/10/AFP_324B3AQ.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "London Tube drivers in line for big pay rise from April"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/01/31/12/MG-STK1115_Movember_Campaign_Image_Toolkit_DAVIDANDREW_PEREZ_HIRes_06%281%29.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Closing the cancer care gap "}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/sport/football/qatar-world-cup-security-workers-forced-labour-amnesty-international-report-b992988.html?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=homepage_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=5", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Qatar World Cup: Security workers subject to \u2018forced labour\u2019 reveals damning report from Amnesty International"}, {"author_container": "By    Dan Kilpatrick @Dan_KP 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 08:57:19"}, {"article_body": "FIFA are \"directly linked to and in some cases contributed to\" shocking human rights abuses of migrant workers at private security firms in Qatar, who were subjected to \"forced labour\" on projects linked to this year's World Cup, according to a scathing new report by Amnesty International.\n The report found that FIFA \"failed to put in place adequate processes\" to prevent the abuse or carry out \"due diligence\" on three private security firms contracted by the world governing body, who were found to have mistreated workers.\n The findings revealed that FIFA are still contracting one of the companies, with Amnesty warning that unless the governing body \"take urgent action...it is highly likely this [abuse] will continue during the World Cup tournament itself\".\n The findings in the 74-page report came from interviews with 34 current and former employees from eight private security companies, up to February this year.\n Each of the firms was found to \"have in some way failed to meet their responsibility to respect human rights under international standards and have breached various provisions of Qatari law\".\n The companies provided services for sites including government ministries and football stadiums, as well as other infrastructure projects essential for the World Cup, such as hotels, transport systems and sports facilities. At least three provided security for recent FIFA tournaments, including the Club World Cup.\n The report states: \"Neither FIFA nor the Supreme Committee conducted adequate due diligence before contracting the three private security companies highlighted in this report and they both failed to identify in a timely manner the full range of abuses experienced by workers in order that they be effectively addressed and remedied.\n \"As a result, by the time some abuses had been identified, FIFA and its organizing partner had already benefitted from these companies\u2019 services. They were therefore directly linked to and in some cases contributed to the harms suffered by guards in these companies.\n \"They are still contracting with one of the companies, and therefore may still be directly linked or contributing to further abuse. Unless they take urgent action to strengthen their due diligence it is highly likely this will continue during the World Cup tournament itself.\"\n Tens of thousands of migrant workers are employed in the private security sector in Qatar and the report described the \"very serious abuse\" as \"systemic and structural\".\n Among the abuses of workers detailed in the report were:\n - a majority of security guards working 12-hour days, with no time off, for months and sometimes years on end\n - huge fines for mistakes at work\n - pay discrimination on the basis of nationality, race and language\n - substandard and \u201cunsanitary\u201d living conditions, with up to 10 people sharing cramped rooms\n - workers being threatened with large salary deductions if they want to take rest days\n - dangerous working conditions, with guards forced work outside without shelter in searing heat\n - half of the security companies not paying overtime at the rate required by law\n Amnesty said the abuses had been allowed to flourish by the Qatari government's failure to properly enforce the country's new reforms, and accused FIFA and its World Cup delivery partner of failing to deliver on promises \"to improve the working and living conditions\" of the country's migrant workers.\n One security guard from Bangladesh said he did not have a day off for three years, while another, from Kenya said: \u201cThey pay us by nationality. You may find a Kenyan is earning 1,300, but the same security from the Philippines gets 1,500. Tunisians, 1,700. Pay is according to nationality\u201d. \n Another said his bosses used racist stereotypes to justify harsh and discriminatory treatment. \u201cThey say \u2018you are an African, you can work 12 hours because you are strong\u2019,\" he said.\n Accounts of racial discrimination echo the findings of the UN Special Rapporteur - who visited Qatar in late 2019 - on contemporary forms of racism.\n Stephen Cockburn, Amnesty's head of economic and social justice, said: \u201cEmployers are still exploiting their workers in plain sight, and the Qatari authorities must take urgent measures to protect workers and hold abusers accountable.\n \u201cMany of the security guards we spoke to knew their employers were breaking the law but felt powerless to challenge them.\n \u201cPhysically and emotionally exhausted, workers kept reporting for duty under threat of financial penalties - or worse, contract termination or deportation.\n \u201cDespite the progress Qatar has made in recent years, our research suggests that abuses in the private security sector - which will be increasingly in demand during the World Cup - remain systematic and structural.\n \u201cWith the World Cup just months away, FIFA must focus on doing more to prevent abuses in the inherently perilous private security sector, or see the tournament further marred by abuse.\n \u201cMore broadly, FIFA must also use its leverage to pressure Qatar to better implement its reforms and enforce its laws. Time is fast running out - if better practices are not established now, abuses will continue long after fans have gone home.\u201d\n As part of a lengthy statement in response to the report, a FIFA spokesperson said: \"FIFA is steadfast in its commitment to ensure respect for internationally recognised human rights across all its operations and events in accordance with FIFA\u2019s Human Rights Policy and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. FIFA does not accept any abuse of workers by companies involved in the preparation and delivery of the FIFA World Cup 2022...\n \"As part of its regular and ongoing engagement with Amnesty International in relation to the upcoming World Cup, FIFA has provided detailed information about the cases mentioned in their report and the corrective measures that have been applied with the companies involved.\"\n In response to the allegations, Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Labour said last month that they \u201cdo not represent underlying issues with the robust system Qatar has introduced\", and that the prevalence of rule-breaking by companies is in decline.\n The Supreme Committee meanwhile stated that \u201ca programme of the scale of the SCs, which is unique even from an international perspective, will always have contractors who will try to bypass the system\u201d.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

for bilateral relations with Moscow, including by establishing the Nato-Russia Permanent Joint Council as a forum for consultation and co-operation.\n However, Ms Truss was expected to brand this as now \u201cdead\u201d and that it represented an out-dated approach to relations with the Kremlin.\n She also warned against raising hopes too much from Russian troops, having suffered heavy losses, being forced to pull back from around Kyiv and other parts of northern Ukraine.\n \u201cThere is no time for false comfort,\u201d she was expected to stress, as more details of the horrors committed by Russian troops in Bucha, near Kyiv, and other towns and cities are emerging.\n She was due to add: \u201cRussia is not retreating, but regrouping and repositioning to push harder in the East and South of Ukraine.\u201d\n The Cabinet minister was also set to call for the West to rapidly ramp up support to Ukraine, including by giving Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s military the weapons it needs to fight for the Russian president\u2019s invasion to fail, strengthening sanctions, and boosting defences so there are no \u201csecurity vacuums\u201d at the edge of Nato, such as in eastern Europe.\n She was also due to call for a rethink of support for countries \u201ccaught in the web of Russian influence\u201d such as Georgia, Moldova, Sweden and Finland.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

up its supply of military equipment to Ukraine, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Thursday as Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s government issued a plea for \u201cweapons, weapons, weapons\u201d.\n The Cabinet minister stressed that the UK was responding to the call to supply more military hardware to Ukraine to defeat Vladimir Putin\u2019s barbaric invasion.\n Speaking at a Nato meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: \u201cIn the face of Putin\u2019s appalling aggression in Ukraine, the G7 and Nato are stepping up our efforts on sanctions and on weapons.\n \u201cThe UK is now banning all imports of Russian energy, we are sanctioning more banks and we are stepping up our supply of weapons to Ukraine.\u201d\n Britain is set to send protected mobility vehicles to Ukraine, having already supplied thousands of missiles, including anti-tank weapons.\n A Ukrainian military delegation, led by Deputy Defence Minister Volodymyr Havrylov, visited the Salisbury Plain training area earlier this week and was shown the armoured vehicles, as well as loitering munitions, which hang in the air and can then be later deployed against a target, and the high-speed Starstreak missile system which has already been sent to Ukraine.\n It comes after Ukraine on Thursday issued three pleas to Nato members to defeat Vladimir Putin\u2019s barbaric invasion: \u201cWeapons, weapons, weapons\u201d.\n Ahead of the high-level talks in Brussels, the country\u2019s foreign minister stressed more military equipment was vital to prevent \u201cenormous sacrifices\u201d and \u201cmore Buchas\u201d, the town near Kyiv where Russian forces are accused of killing more than 300 civilians in war crimes which included executions, mass graves and rapes.\n Dmytro Kuleba urged countries in the West to \u201cput aside their hesitations, their reluctance\u201d and to supply more arms, stressing that \u201cas weird as it may sound today weapons serve the purpose of peace\u201d.\n Issuing his appeal, he said: \u201cMy agenda is very simple, it has only three items on it.\n \u201cIt\u2019s weapons, weapons and weapons.\n \u201cWe are confident that the best way to help Ukraine now is to provide it will all necessary to contain Putin and to defeat the Russian army in Ukraine so that the war does not spill over.\u201d\n He stressed that the Ukrainian army and nation had shown the world that \u201cwe know how to fight\u201d and \u201chow to win\u201d against the Russian president\u2019s troops.\n \u201cBut without sustainable and sufficient supplies of all weapons requested by Ukraine, these wins will be accompanied with enormous sacrifices,\u201d he added.\n \u201cThe more weapons we get and the sooner they arrive in Ukraine, the more human lives will be saved, the more cities and villages will not be destructed and there will be no more Buchas.\n \u201cI call on all allies to put aside their hesitations, their reluctance, to provide Ukraine with everything it needs because as weird as it may sound but today weapons serve the purpose of peace.\u201d\n Mr Kuleba stressed that Ukraine\u2019s military needs planes, heavy air defence system, and missiles vehicles from Nato members.\n The alliance is not itself providing any weapons, amid concerns that if it did this could allow Mr Putin to seek to escalate the conflict into one between Nato and Russia, so military equipment is being provided by individual nations in bilateral arrangements, even if co-ordinated between allies.\n Britain has provided thousands of missiles, including anti-tank weapons, and is reported to be considering sending armoured vehicles which would allow Ukrainian troops to advance with better protection closer towards Russian-occupied territory.\n The Czech government is reported to have been sending Soviet era tanks which Ukrainian forces are trained in using.\n The US has already provided more than $2.3 billion (\u00a31.7 billion) of lethal assistance to Ukraine since January 2021, including a a $100 million (\u00a376 million) transfer of Javelin anti-armour missiles announced days ago, and was also reported to be training Ukrainian forces in the use of military drones.\n Meanwhile, a fifth round of European Union sanctions on Russia, including a ban on coal imports, could be agreed by the bloc on Thursday or on Friday, the EU\u2019s top diplomat Josep Borrell said.\n \u201cMaybe this afternoon, or tomorrow at the latest,\u201d he said as he arrived at the Nato meeting.\n Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who was attending the summit, announced on Wednesday that the UK was freezing the assets of Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest bank, and Credit Bank of Moscow, banning all new investment in Russia and targeting eight more oligarchs.\n The move came after Boris Johnson said the actions of Russian forces in Ukraine appeared close to \u201cgenocide\u201d.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

But the judge had revealed the basis for the dispute in an earlier ruling, allowing publicity to correct misinformation that had been leaked from within the government.\n Making his decision, the judge said the name and image of X would be blocked from publication, while other aspects of his identity may also be included in the interim injunction.\n The government said during the dispute that it does not object to the BBC making allegations about a source\u2019s behaviour, but believes naming the man known as X was wrong.\n In a statement issued after the ruling, the BBC said the judgment did not prevent it from reporting \u201ckey elements\u201d of its story once restrictions are determined.\n A spokesperson for the broadcaster said: \u201cThis is not the judgment we had hoped for, but it is important to understand what it does and does not mean.\n \u201cWhile the judgment prevents the BBC from identifying X, by showing his picture or naming him, it does not prevent the BBC from reporting key elements of the story, which we will do once the precise restrictions are determined.\n \u201cWe expect these restrictions to be clarified next week.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

accused of taking videos of CCTV systems at the embassy, amassing documents marked \u2018secret\u2019, and making copies with a view to leaking to Russia, it is said. \n The security guard at the embassy in Berlin is accused of writing a letter to General Major Sergey Chukhurov, the military attach\u00e9 at the Russian Embassy in Germany, containing a cache of sensitive details. \n Smith is accused of nine breaches of the Official Secrets Act, between October 2020 and August last year, and appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday. \n Flanked by two plain-clothes guards, Smith pleaded not guilty to all nine charges as his case was sent to the Old Bailey for trial by Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring. \n Smith, dressed in a blue jumper and jeans and speaking with a Scottish accent, confirmed hs name and age before adding: \u201cI don\u2019t have an address at the moment.\u201d\n He used a hearing aid to follow proceedings, and was remanded in custody until a

GRU)\u201d, when he allegedly \u201ccommunicated information, namely about the building repairs to the British Embassy, Berlin\u201d.\n He was extradited from Germany to the UK on Wednesday and held overnight in custody ahead of today\u2019s court appearance.\n He was initially arrested in August last year, with authorisation sought from the UK Attorney General to bring criminal charges in

times in the UK\u2019s favourite sunshine destination in time for the first busy holiday period of the year.\n But Spanish Health Minister Carolina Darias told regional officials on Wednesday the government was not planning on approving the lifting of their mandatory status in public spaces indoors like restaurants and hotels until April 19.\n Their mandatory use indoors is expect to end between April 21 or 22 when the new ruling is published in an Official State Bulletin.\n They are expected to remain obligatory after that date only in hospitals, retirement homes and on public transport.\n Easter Sunday this year falls on April 17 and most British families heading out to Spain this year will have returned home by the time the new rules on face masks come into force.\n Face masks became mandatory in all public spaces in Spain on May 20 two years ago, with their obligatory use outdoors only being lifted in February after restrictions were reintroduced around Christmas.\n Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez, addressing members of his left-wing PSOE party at the start of last month, said: \u201cWe have the lowest cumulative rate of coronavirus right now in Europe and soon, very soon, when our Health Minister says so, we\u2019ll be able to remove the mandatory status of face masks indoors.\u201d\n Experts in areas like the Costa Blanca, which includes the popular holiday resort of Benidorm, reacted by putting a timeline on the move of between three and five weeks.\n The use of face masks in public spaces indoors in Spain remains the most visible sign of the coronavirus pandemic.\n Virtually all other restrictions put in place at the height of the health crisis have already been lifted.\n Some experts have said they would prefer to see the current face masks rules remain in place until after the summer.\n The move to banish them from most parts of everyday life will be welcomed by many parents whose young children have had to wear them at school for hours on end for the last two years.\n Many Spaniards still use them outdoors despite the fact they are not obliged to do so.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

strategy based on \u201cdefence, deterrence and resilence\u201d.\n Liz Truss was due to deliver the landmark message at a working dinner of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels where she was also set to call for the West to quickly and decisively supply more weapons to Ukraine.\n For years, the UK and other European nations have sought to keep on engaging with Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime despite its numerous acts of aggression including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the 2018 Novichok poisonings in Salisbury.\n But the Foreign Secretary stressed Mr Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, where his forces have committed atrocities widely condemned as war crimes with thousands of civilians killed, meant this policy now had to be ditched.\n \u201cThe age of engagement with Russia is over,\u201d she was due to say.\n \u201cWe need a new approach to security in Europe based on resilience, defence and deterrence.\u201d\n The 1997 Nato-Russia Founding Act provided the formal basis for bilateral relations with Moscow, including by establishing the Nato-Russia Permanent Joint Council as a forum for consultation and co-operation.\n However, Ms Truss was expected to brand this as now \u201cdead\u201d and that it represented an out-dated approach to relations with the Kremlin.\n She also warned against raising hopes too much from Russian troops, having suffered heavy losses, being forced to pull back from around Kyiv and other parts of northern Ukraine.\n \u201cThere is no time for false comfort,\u201d she was expected to stress, as more details of the horrors committed by Russian troops in Bucha, near Kyiv, and other towns and cities are emerging.\n She was due to add: \u201cRussia is not retreating, but regrouping and repositioning to push harder in the East and South of Ukraine.\u201d\n The Cabinet minister was also set to call for the West to rapidly ramp up support to Ukraine, including by giving Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s military the weapons it needs to fight for the Russian president\u2019s invasion to fail, strengthening sanctions, and boosting defences so there are no \u201csecurity vacuums\u201d at the edge of Nato, such as in eastern Europe.\n

foreign income.\n The Independent reported Akshata Murthy, who is believed to be worth hundreds of billions of pounds, held non-dom status.\n This means her permanent home is considered outside of the UK and, although she is still liable for UK tax on income made in this country, she does not have to pay UK tax on foreign income unless it is brought into the UK.\n The newspaper claims the status could have saved the Chancellor\u2019s wife millions of pounds in tax on foreign earnings but a spokeswoman for Ms Murthy said she has always paid UK taxes on her UK income.\n The non-dom status is lawful and it is understood Ms Murthy pays foreign taxes on her overseas income.\n But Labour said: \u201cThe Chancellor has imposed tax hike after tax hike on the British people.\n \u201cIt is staggering that, at the same time, his family may have been benefitting from tax reduction schemes. This is yet another example of the Tories thinking it is one rule for them, another for everyone else.\n \u201cRishi Sunak must now urgently explain how much he and his family have saved on their own tax bill at the same time he was putting taxes up for millions of working families and choosing to leave them \u00a32,620 a year worse off.\u201d\n A spokeswoman for Ms Murthy confirmed she held non-dom status and said: \u201cAkshata Murthy is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parent\u2019s home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously.\n \u201cSo, according to British law, Ms Murthy is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.\u201d\n It is understood Mr Sunak declared his wife\u2019s tax status when he became a minister in 2018 and the Treasury was also aware so that any potential conflicts could be managed.\n Ms Murthy is listed on LinkedIn as being director of capital and private equity firm Catamaran Ventures, gym chain Digme Fitness, and gentlemen\u2019s outfitters New and Lingwood.\n She is also reported to hold a 0.91% stake in Infosys, which was founded by her now billionaire father.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/09/09e73492a9ce64b480868a95c225375bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5NDA3NzY1-2.66247047.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Sunak\u2019s family accused of \u2018sheltering\u2019 from UK tax with wife\u2019s non-dom status"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/19/2476d19e1a6ec6f99344ebc2e1fe96e9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzU2MzA1-2.61626526.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Business secretary forced to defend Rishi Sunak\u2019s wife over tax status"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/12/2ca1b818b885d8a1c7714f4946325df5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzMwNDcz-2.66244964.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Johnson says putting up tax to fund NHS is \u2018unquestionably right\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/24/12/ANTALYA%201.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Antalya: a stunning destination for fans of the great outdoors"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/19/2476d19e1a6ec6f99344ebc2e1fe96e9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzU2MzA1-2.61626526.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=2303%3A1231%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Rishi Sunak\u2019s wife has defended her non-domicile status </p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/comment/tenner-bring-own-birthday-cake-cakeage-restaurant-london-b992767.html?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=homepage_trending_article_component&itm_campaign=editors_picks&itm_content=1", "page_details": [{"post_title": "A tenner to bring my own birthday cake?

nuclear, wind, solar and hydrogen in its long-awaited energy strategy.\n Ministers are promising \u201ccleaner and more affordable energy\u201d to be made in this country, aiming to make 95% of electricity low carbon by 2030.\n But Labour said the Prime Minister had \u201ccaved to his own backbenchers\u201d and that the plan would do nothing to help the rising energy costs faced by households.\n Boris Johnson said the strategy, including new nuclear and offshore wind plans, would reduce the UK\u2019s dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n There has been particular worldwide concern about the reliance on Russian oil and gas since the Kremlin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n Under the Government\u2019s fresh plans a new body, Great British Nuclear, will be launched to bolster the UK\u2019s nuclear capacity with the hope of up to 24 gigawatts (GW) of electricity by 2050 coming from the source of power, 25% of the projected electricity demand.\n It is hoped the focus on nuclear will deliver up to eight reactors, equivalent to one reactor a year instead of one a decade.\n The strategy also confirmed the intention to push ahead with a nuclear project at the Wylfa site on the island of Anglesey, off the north-west coast of Wales.\n Mr Johnson said: \u201cWe\u2019re setting out bold plans to scale up and accelerate affordable, clean and secure energy made in Britain, for Britain, from new nuclear to offshore wind, in the decade ahead.\n \u201cThis will reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper bills.\u201d\n The rocketing energy bills faced by families have been caused in part by a post-pandemic rise in demand for gas, with lower levels of production.\n This was only exacerbated by the war in Ukraine both due to energy supplies but also the production of wheat and some metals.\n On offshore wind, the plan outlines the ambition of producing up to 50GW of energy by 2030, which the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said would be more than enough to power every home in the UK.\n Some 5GW should come from floating offshore wind in deeper seas and planning reforms will slash approval times for new wind farms from four years to one year.\n It is thought a major crunch point in the strategy, and one of the reasons its launch has been delayed, is wrangling over onshore wind farms.\n Several ministers have aired views backing the development of new oil and gas, but not onshore wind, which is one of the cheapest forms of electricity, along with solar.\n Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg downplayed the earthquake risks from fracking and suggested \u201cevery last drop\u201d of oil should be extracted from the North Sea, while Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he did not favour a vast increase in onshore wind farms as he said they \u201ccan create something of an eyesore\u201d.\n The Government said it would be \u201cconsulting on developing partnerships with a limited number of supportive communities who wish to host new onshore wind infrastructure in return for guaranteed lower energy bills\u201d.\n It has already commissioned a review into the science around fracking, which could pave the way to lifting the moratorium on the controversial process, imposed over the tremors it caused.\n A \u00a330m competition to manufacture heat pumps is also to be launched, and there are ambitions to increase solar capacity with a consultation of the rules for solar projects.\n Plus, the Government aims to double its goal of low carbon hydrogen production to 10GW by 2030, with at least half of that coming from green hydrogen.\n Meanwhile, on oil and gas, a new licensing round for new North Sea oil and gas projects is planned for the autumn to cover the \u201cnearer term\u201d.\n Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: \u201cWe have seen record-high gas prices around the world.\n \u201cWe need to protect ourselves from price spikes in the future by accelerating our move towards cleaner, cheaper, home-grown energy.\n \u201cThe simple truth is that the more cheap, clean power we generate within our borders, the less exposed we will be to eye-watering fossil fuel prices set by global markets we can\u2019t control.\n \u201cScaling up cheap renewables and new nuclear, while maximising North Sea production, is the best and only way to ensure our energy independence over the coming years.\u201d\n The plan was welcomed by offshore wind firm Orsted, trade association Hydrogen UK, Shell and EDF, among others.\n Nuclear Industry Association chief executive Tom Greatrex said the new nuclear target of 24GW by 2050 \u201cis a vital step forward for UK energy security and our net zero future\u201d.\n But Ed Miliband, Labour\u2019s shadow climate change and net-zero secretary, said: \u201cThe Government\u2019s energy relaunch is in disarray.\n \u201cBoris Johnson has completely caved to his own backbenchers and now, ludicrously, his own energy strategy has failed on the sprint we needed on onshore wind and solar, the cheapest, cleanest forms of homegrown power.\n \u201cThis relaunch will do nothing for the millions of families now facing an energy bills crisis.\n \u201cNo reversal of the ban on onshore wind and not a penny more on energy efficiency.\n \u201cThese decisions will force households to pay hundreds of pounds more for their energy bills and keep the UK dependent on imported gas for longer.\u201d\n Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the plans were \u201cutterly hopeless\u201d.\n Climate think tank E3G said the announced plans had \u201cfailed to support the action needed to either get off Russian gas this year or bring down energy bills\u201d.\n Ed Matthew, campaigns director at E3G said: \u201cWith no new support to save energy and by holding back on solar power and onshore wind, this strategy will do nothing to help the UK get off Russian gas this year.\n \u201cInstead, the Government has prioritised policies that will keep us dependent on high-cost fossil fuels and nuclear power.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t an energy security strategy and will do nothing to bring down energy bills.\n \u201cIt is a national security threat and the person who will be happiest with it is Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

London river was found dead on a golf course a few days later, according to locals.\n Thames Water told locals the toxic oil spill in Beverley Brook, which runs through Richmond Park, was caused by \u201cillegal flytipping\u201d.\n The culprit is unknown but thought to be a commercial company.\n Sarah Olney, Lib Dem MP for Richmond Park, moved to reassure her constituents that she was told there would be minimal impact on animals. \n She tweeted: \u201cThe Environment Agency are continuing to clean up the waste. \n \u201cFortunately, they don\u2019t believe the remaining pollution will have any environmental impact on the Thames and it appears there has been a minimal impact on fish & wildlife.\u201d\n However, one man replied with an image of a heron covered in oil close to the polluted brook and said he believed it to be the same one found dead on a New Malden golf course.\n A volunteer from London Wildlife Protection said: \u201cThe really sad thing is that he suffered.\n \u201cThe smell was awful. The problem is it is really difficult to get rid of everything, it is really thick and black and gets caught up in shrubs along the way so it can get logged for some time then move on.\u201d\n They added: \u201cWe were contacted by people from the golf course, the heron had been visiting there for two years. He must have suffered. He had been seen like that for a couple of days at least and people had been trying to catch him.\u201d\n Another bird lover, who first identified the toxic spill, told The Standard: \u201cThere are many herons and water birds that use the brook, along with all other wildlife. A oil dump like this will affect the entire food chain.\u201d\n Beverley Brook\u2019s name is derived from the former presence in the river of the European beaver a species extinct in Britain since the sixteenth century\n In the aftermath of the spill dog walkers on Wimbledon and Putney Commons and Richmond Park were warned against letting their dogs enter the water. \n An Environment Agency spokeswoman said: \u201cWe were informed on Sunday afternoon of oil pollution in the Beverly Brook which flows through Richmond Park.\n \u201cOur officers went onsite with Thames Water to trace the source and also assess the impact of the pollution. Thames Water have begun the clean-up operation and we will continue to monitor the situation.\n \u201cMembers of the public should report pollution incidents to our free 24-hour Incident Hotline on 0800 807060.\u201d\n Nobody has been prosecuted so far for the oil spill.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/09/newFile-5.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Warning to dog walkers as oil spill pollutes brook near Richmond Park"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/19/2022-04-06T173723Z_997234076_UP1EI461CY957_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-CHAMPIONS-CHE-MAD-REPORT.JPG?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "You must prioritise residents, Chelsea bidders are warned"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/01/22/d096c5c745e27d25bc1e5ac0e97a0d07Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4OTM1MDk3-2.57157258.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Jubilee Line to get 4G permanently after successful pilot"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/08/12/Secret_Cinema_-_Bridgerton_-_16th_February_2022_by_Luke_Dyson_-_LD2_0032.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Bridgerton fans: don\u2019t miss this immersive Secret Cinema experience"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/uk/ricky-gervais-dismisses-jada-pinkett-smith-alopecia-disability-will-smith-oscars-slap-b993020.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "1/57Ricky Gervais - In pictures"}, {"author_container": "By    Tina Campbell 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 10:58:36"}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/crime/northolt-teenager-stabbed-face-london-crime-police-b992995.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Horror as teenager, 18, is stabbed in the face in Northolt"}, {"author_container": "By    Barney Davis @BarneyDavisES 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 10:16:52"}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-wife-akshata-murthy-kwasi-kwarteng-non-dom-tax-status-b992976.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng forced to defend Rishi Sunak\u2019s wife over non-dom tax status"}, {"author_container": "By    Rachael Burford Political Reporter @RachaelBurford 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 08:57:35"}, {"article_body": "The non-domiciled tax status of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife is \"absolutely right\", a government minister insisted on Thursday as he was forced to defend the arrangement. \n The status means Akshata Murthy, whose personal fortune is estimated to be more than \u00a3400m making her one of the wealthiest women in Britain, does not legally have to pay UK tax on income she earns abroad.\n Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the Chancellor had always been \"transparent\" about the status his wife holds. \n \"I think it's absolutely right,\" he told Times Radio. \n \"I think it's clear she has non-domiciled status. We've had non domicile status for more than 200 years. \n \"And that means that on UK income, you pay taxes here in the UK, and on foreign income, you pay taxes abroad. That's something that's been well established. \n \u201cThe Chancellor has been very transparent about this. It's always been in this declaration of interests. \n \"I think there's a lot of malicious attacks on someone who is a private citizen and is not a politician.\"\n The news comes as Mr Sunak hiked National Insurance contributions by an extra 1.25p in the pound.\n From this week millions of employees and businesses will pay more tax as the country faces a cost of living crisis, with increasing energy and food bills and rising inflation. \n Ms Murthy, a fashion designer who married Mr Sunak in 2009, was born in India and holds Indian citizenship. The country does not allow its nationals to hold dual citizenship. \n She said she pays all the tax that she is legally required to in the UK.\n Ms Murthy\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cAkshata Murthy is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents\u2019 home. \n \u201cIndia does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously.\u201d\n Ms Murthy has lived in the UK for nine years and will automatically be deemed domiciled after six more, meaning she will have to begin paying taxes on all her income. \n Her billionaire father N.R Narayana Murthy founded the IT services company, Infosys, which is one of India's biggest firms. Ms Murthy, 42, is reported to own a little under 1 per cent of the shares of Infosys, which are said to have a value of more than \u00a3500m. \n She will have have received more than \u00a311 million in dividends from the company in the past tax year. But her non-dom tax status means she would not have had to pay UK tax on the dividend at a rate of 38.1 per cent.\n Ms Murthy also has interests in several companies in the UK. \n Last month Digme Fitness, a London boutique Ms Murthy had invested in and was a director of, collapsed leaving the taxpayer to pick up its debts of \u00a3415,000. Ms Murthy owned less than five per cent of the company.\n The collapse of the company came after it received up to \u00a3635,000 in furlough payments for staff during the pandemic. \n Mr Kwarteng said he was \u201ccompletely comfortable\u201d with Ms Murthy\u2019s business dealings. \n \"I'm totally comfortable with people having businesses, people operating what they do as private citizens, I'm completely comfortable about that,\u201d he told Sky News.\n \"I'm not an expert on her financial arrangements but I think absolutely people have a right to pursue their own business arrangements.\u201d \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/09/09e73492a9ce64b480868a95c225375bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5NDA3NzY1-2.66247047.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Sunak\u2019s family accused of \u2018sheltering\u2019 from UK tax with wife\u2019s non-dom status"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/19/f5e12200c1a625306ad5c51bdf219747Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzU2Mjc4-2.65196272.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Labour calls on Rishi Sunak to explain wife\u2019s non-dom tax status"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/12/2ca1b818b885d8a1c7714f4946325df5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzMwNDcz-2.66244964.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Johnson says putting up tax to fund NHS is \u2018unquestionably right\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/24/15/%C4%B0STANBUL%201.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Why your next break should be to Istanbul"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/world/james-corden-carpool-karaoke-returns-after-twoyear-break-nicki-minaj-adele-b992991.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Watch: James Corden teams up with Nicki Minaj as Carpool Karaoke returns after two-year break"}, {"author_container": "By    Tina Campbell 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 10:08:45"}, {"article_body": "James Corden\u2019s Carpool Karaoke made a welcome return on Wednesday night after taking a two-year break due to the pandemic.\n Rapper Nicki Minaj, 39, helped kick off proceedings as she joined The Late Late Show host in his SUV to sing along to some of her biggest hits, including Anaconda, Starships and Chun-Li.\n She also channelled her inner Adele - complete with British accent - for a rendition of Someone Like You.\n Adele appeared on the popular segment back in 2016 where she took on Minaj\u2019s track Monster.\n James Corden Carpool Karaoke with Adele\n Speaking to Cordon on his chat show earlier this year, Minaj said that seeing Adele impersonate her had \u201cmade my day, my year\u201d.\n \u201cI probably got a thousand phone calls about that one thing,\u201d she added.\n Minaj\u2019s turn on Carpool Karaoke clearly had an impact on people too.\n \u201cI was jamming out to see starships along with @NICKIMINAJ during her #NICKICARPOOL.

Benzema continued his vintage form with a masterclass in the art of centre-forward play.\n His two first-half headed goals were so exquisitely dispatched that he would have struggled to be more precise had he picked the ball up with both hands and placed it in the net.\n His deftness of touch repeatedly had Chelsea players losing their feet and their heads \u2014 and while his hat-trick goal, which put Madrid 3-1 up and firmly in control of this quarter-final at the halfway stage, was the result of a clownish mix-up between Edouard Mendy and Antonio Rudiger, it felt like a result of the panic his very presence provoked in Thomas Tuchel\u2019s side.\n Maybe Chelsea\u2019s manager was guilty of lauding Benzema too heartily on the eve of this game, admitting he was the player above all he would want to add to his European champions. Perhaps his reputation preceded him and Chelsea were overawed before the first whistle blew.\n The problem where Benzema is concerned is that he can back up all the talk with his actions; it would not take Tuchel giving him the big sell to see him get into Chelsea heads \u2014 he can do that all by himself.\n Benzema represents everything that Chelsea are not at the cutting edge of the pitch. He is a game-changer, a ruthlessly efficient finisher and a focal point for everything Madrid do.\n Kai Havertz, whose first-half header provided his side with the slenderest of lifelines, is Tuchel\u2019s best option up front, but it is unfair to expect him to come close to the numbers Benzema is producing: 42 goals and counting this season.\n Romelu Lukaku, meanwhile, is not even trusted for a game of this magnitude, with his consignment to the bench justified by his failure to hit the target with a header from six yards out that Tuchel admits could be critical.\n \u201cIt was very important,\u201d said the German. \u201cThere are no more away goals, so if we have only a one-goal deficit or a draw, then you see the momentum is back when we score.\n \u201cTo come back with a chance like this at 3-2, after 16 shots in the second half alone, then goals are crucial. We didn\u2019t get them.\u201d\n The question for Chelsea, with five days to go until the second leg and with the defence of their Champions League crown hanging by a thread, is how do they stop Benzema at the Bernabeu?\n The warning after Saturday\u2019s 4-1 defeat to Brentford was that a performance anything like as abject against Madrid would be heavily punished. And so it proved, with only the width of the bar denying Vinicius Jr from putting the visitors ahead after just 10 minutes and Benzema scuffing wide from close range before the break.\n There are few similarities between Madrid\u2019s captain and Brentford midfielder Vitaly Janelt, who scored twice at the Bridge on Saturday. The common denominator is a Chelsea defence that looks flimsier by the day. It was alarming the ease with which Vinicius Jr left Andreas Christensen flailing, which, in turn, desperately exposed Thiago Silva.\n Christensen is Barcelona-bound \u2014 and on this evidence, Madrid fans will be relishing the first Clasico of next season.\n In the Dane\u2019s defence, he was not part of the Brentford horror show, but this hardly represented a strong argument to suggest he could have made a positive difference to that result.\n It is a measure of just how incensed Tuchel was by his team that he replaced N\u2019Golo Kante at half-time. Chelsea\u2019s \u2018Superman\u2019 was powerless to stop Madrid repeatedly careering through central areas, with David Alaba being allowed to collect the ball on the edge of his own box in the first half before driving all the way into Chelsea\u2019s final third without being dispossessed.\n Tuchel\u2019s side have lost the protection that has made them so hard to beat during his reign. That is why he was so alarmed last night, especially after the wake-up call provided by Brentford.\n Perhaps his assertion that the tie is dead was a little premature \u2014 but a repeat performance at the Bernabeu and their reign as European champions certainly will be.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/11/newFile-7.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Mason Mount issues Chelsea rallying cry after Real Madrid horror show: \u2018We can turn this tie around\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/22/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Chelsea\u2019s defence hanging by a thread after classy Karim Benzema frightens European champions into submission"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/22/2022-04-06T190611Z_1566835333_UP1EI461H29A3_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-CHAMPIONS-CHE-MAD-REPORT.JPG?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Chelsea player ratings vs Real Madrid: Kante not his usual self as Kovacic shows why he had to start"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/23/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Chelsea\u2019s Champions League defence is over, declares Thomas Tuchel as coach fears total collapse after defeat"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/21/newFile-3.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Chelsea 1-3 Real Madrid: Karim Benzema masterclass sinks error-strewn European champions"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/11/newFile-20.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=978%3A652%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Karim Benzema made it back-to-back Champions League hat-tricks against Chelsea </p>"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/11/newFile-21.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=852%3A568%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Benzema\u2019s performance echoed Brazilian Ronaldo\u2019s masterclass at Old Trafford in 2003 </p>"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/11/newFile-23.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=1486%3A991%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Benzema\u2019s performance was on another planet to Romelu Lukaku, whose struggles continue </p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/grand-national-2022-how-can-i-watch-aintree-meeting-live-tv-coverage-stream-free-uk-today-b992855.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Grand National 2022 live stream: How can I watch Aintree meeting on TV in UK for FREE today?"}, {"author_container": "By    Malik Ouzia @MalikOuzia_ 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 10:45:03"}, {"article_body": "One of the most iconic sporting events of the years takes place on Saturday as Aintree hosts the Grand National. \n The world\u2019s most famous horserace headlines three days of top class racing at the Liverpool track, with 21 races in all starting on Thursday afternoon. \n Fans will be back on course for the meeting for the first time since 2019, while millions more are expected to tune in around the country.\n Here\u2019s how you can follow the action...\n Grand National 2022 dates and start times\n The Grand National Meeting gets underway on Thursday, April 7 and runs across three days, culminating on Saturday, April 9.\n Each day features seven races, with the first starting at 1:45pm.

The lowest earners face a potential \u00a31,300 fall to their incomes as real wages fall by around 2%.\n The introduction of economic sanctions on Russia has added one percentage point to PwC\u2019s inflationary outlook. It now sees inflation peaking at 8.4% in the second quarter of 2022.\n PwC has also outlined an \u201ceconomic escalation\u201d scenario, which would include a \u201csubstantial disruption to Russian exports of oil and gas. In this doomsday scenario, UK economic growth would be downgraded to 2.8%, and inflation could peak at 11%.\n Deutsche Bank this week that said the UK economy would contract by 0.2% in the April to June quarter, before rebounding in the third quarter, but would flatline by the end of the year as household energy bills rise.\n \u201cWe continue to think that the risk of recession remains on the rise,\u201d said\u00a0Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief UK economist Sanjay Raja.\n \u201cThis is something we will be tracking very closely in the coming months. Consumer confidence data is already consistent with recessionary levels.\u201d\n Nick Forrest, UK economics consulting leader at PwC, said: \u201cBeyond the tragic humanitarian impacts of the war in Ukraine, there are wider economic consequences, as Russia and Ukraine are key exporters of commodities such as car batteries, food and fertiliser.\n \u201cRussia is also a major energy supplier. It is clear that many households and businesses will be feeling great pressure from rising costs this year.\u201d\n Forrest added that although UK has not yet faced a growth crisis, it is facing an \u201cinflation crisis\u201d.\n Figures compiled by the Treasury show the private sector downgraded forecasts for UK growth this year from 4.4% to 4.1% last month.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/10/0300ce1b9804b0f846c59058f710b9cfY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5NDEwNzU4-2.65896959.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "UK households \u2018face record \u00a3900 income hit this year\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/06/07/09/8d7976007161a58979d40f226891aa78Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjIzMTM3OTYz-2.51300342.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "S4 Capital should be more up front about deal spree whatever happens with audit"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/11/10/09/MartinSorrell071121v1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "FTSE report: Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s S4 Capital falls further after auditor delay"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/04/11/Mugla_Dalyan_Canal_morass_6720x4480px%20%281%29.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Why you need to explore T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Dalaman region for yourself "}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/business/888-william-hill-price-caesars-entertainment-uk-gambling-review-b992977.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "888 cuts price of William Hill takeover by \u00a3250 million"}, {"author_container": "By    Rhiannon Curry 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 10:34:15"}, {"article_body": "Betting firm 888 Holdings has knocked \u00a3250 million off the price it is willing to pay for the European arm of rival William Hill, citing \u201cchanges in the macro economic and regulatory environment\u201d and the looming UK gambling licence review.\n The company announced on Thursday morning that it now valued William Hill\u2019s assets at between \u00a31.95 billion and \u00a32.05 billion, down from the \u00a32.2 billion 888 had initially agreed to pay last September.\n The government launched a review of gambling laws in December 2020, amid mounting concern about addiction and children\u2019s exposure via football sponsorship and advertising.\n A white paper is due to be published next month and is likely to set out reforms to the industry, potentially impacting the value of gambling companies.\n US-based Caesars Entertainment bought William Hill in a $4 billion deal last year but it is selling off its European assets.\n The deal gives online operator 888 access to William Hill\u2019s two million active UK customers and its 1,400 UK betting shops.\n 888 today reduced the cash needed for the William Hill deal from \u00a3834.9 million to \u00a3584.9 million, due to deferral of part of the payment.

The oil major said adjusted earnings wouldn\u2019t be impacted.\n Shell announced plans to quit all joint ventures with Kremlin-controlled Gazprom shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, putting the cost at $3 billion. Last month it bowed to pressure to stop buying Russian oil and gas, and announced plans to shut petrol stations in Russia and stop supplying aviation fuel.\n It said today: \u201cShell has not renewed longer-term contracts for Russian oil, and will only do so under explicit government direction, but we are legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion.\u201d\n The update marks the first detailed estimate of how much the international boycott of Russia could cost energy businesses.\n Shell shares dropped 2.3%. BP fell even further, declining 2.4%. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the steeper fall was \u201clikely on a read-across as investors looked at what it might imply for its much larger Russian footprint.\u201d\n Susannah Streeter at Hargreaves Lansdown said: \u201cThe divestment far outweighs the reputational damage which could be caused had it not pulled out.\u201d\n Oil and gas prices have surged in recent weeks amid disruption to international fuel supplies. Higher prices are good for suppliers like Shell but are causing short-term issues. \n The company is a big energy user itself and warned that cash flow had been \u201cnegatively impacted by very significant working capital outflows\u201d. \u201cUnprecedented volatility in commodity prices\u201d has seen around $7 billion leave the business during the current quarter.\n Higher operating costs are a short term issue and Shell said a $10 increase in the value of a barrel of Brent crude should increase profits at its integrated gas and upstream businesses by $3.5 billion across the year. The price of Brent crude has risen by over $20 per barrel since the start of 2022.\n The update came as the government set out its long-awaited Energy Security Strategy. The plans will see the UK ramp up wind, solar and nuclear power generation but also features a renewed push for North Sea oil and gas development. The government said this was \u201crecognising the importance of these fuels to the transition and to our energy security\u201d.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

the sole preserve of the local multiplex and the hellaciously expensive home cinema rooms of our extra well-heeled, the use of projectors has grown steadily in popularity amongst members of the everyday populace.\n There a handful of reasons for this. Firstly, \u2018smart\u2019 technology has evolved so rapidly that now you no longer need a dedicated room rammed with racks of expensive AV gear just to chuck a film on - a suitable smartphone or tablet will do. Secondly, in response to that smart tech getting progressively smarter, projector manufacturers started making more models specifically designed to work with it. Thirdly, seeing just how well all this was going, new manufacturers appeared out of seemingly nowhere, flooding the projector market with all manner of models and giving the paying public the widest array of options ever. Finally, because there is now such an almost overwhelming tsunami of picture-pitchers available, prices were driven down to the point that you can now pick up a decent quality portable projector for sums starting at sub-\u00a3200.\n However, as with most tech, you still generally get what you pay for. But whilst the top-end, top-dollar, fixed-place light-throwers will always win in terms of picture quality, today\u2019s high-def-image-offering portable projectors can still smash sport, games, movies, streamed TV channels and, of course, video calls with the added convenience of, once you\u2019ve finished using it, you can just pick it up and put it away.\n So, what makes a decent portable projector? Well, you\u2019re going to want high-definition resolution. You need plenty of lumens of light and a high contrast ratio to ensure excellent image quality. A reliable wireless connection, a decent projection distance that can handle both near and far and stereo sound is essential. For the latter you can link up portable speakers, a soundbar or other such stereo system as most \u2013 most \u2013 built-in speakers just don\u2019t cut it. Oh and, not wanting to state the obvious, to truly fulfil the brief, it has to be portable.\n So, in answer to my own question, what makes a decent portable projector? This little lot do\u2026\n VerdictAdmittedly, I\u2019ve absolutely run the gamut of cost when it comes to the image-throwers I picked for this piece. However, when it comes to striking that perfect balance of price, performance and living the portable projector dream, there is one clear winner for me: the Nebula Solar. Available with a carry case and fitted with a rechargeable battery, this Full HD pint-sized projector delivers on all fronts (including audio), providing instant, automatic, AV excellence everywhere you whip it out and all without breaking the bank.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/12/22/10/newFile-8.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Best projectors: Portable and home cinema projectors for every occasion and budget "}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/07/20/Panasonic%20lifestyle.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Best smart TVs of 2022 from Samsung, LG, Panasonic and more"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/20/09/i360-lifestyle.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Best turntables for all budgets "}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/21/12/philipssunrisealarmclock.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Best sunrise wake-up light alarm clocks in the UK 2022"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/10/18/XP-Pen%20Artist%2012.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Best drawing tablets of 2022 from portable options to larger screens"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/21/16/shark%20Lifestyle%202.png?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Best air purifiers to improve the air quality of your home"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/22/17/6-Nebula-Solarjpg?width=968&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=968%3A645%2Csmart", "alt": ""}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/22/17/2-Epson-EF-11jpg?width=968&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=968%3A645%2Csmart", "alt": ""}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/22/17/3-CapsuleII_01%E5%9C%BA%E6%99%AF.jpg%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%ACjpg?width=968&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=968%3A645%2Csmart", "alt": ""}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/22/17/4-Epson-EF-12jpg?width=968&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=968%3A645%2Csmart", "alt": ""}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/22/17/5-LG-CineBeam_Product-00jpg?width=968&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=968%3A645%2Csmart", "alt": ""}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/22/17/1-Lenco-LPJ-700BKGY_HEROjpg?width=968&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=968%3A645%2Csmart", "alt": ""}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/shopping/esbest/kids/toys-games/best-toy-storage-solutions-b988791.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Best toy storage solutions: Units and boxes to help you save space"}, {"author_container": "By    Charlotte Kewley 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 08:48:14"}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/shopping/esbest/gadgets-tech/best-webcams-streaming-video-calls-b987117.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Best webcams to crush video calls and conferences"}, {"author_container": "By    Stuart Pritchard 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 08:47:14"}, {"article_body": "Cast your mind back, if you can, to the wild, lazy days of lockdown. No, not the bits where you could go to the pub in groups of no more than six, sat two metres from each other and all holding a substantial Scotch eggs, but to the actual lockdown bit of lockdown where nobody could go to work. Netflix became lifeblood and leaving the house for an hour\u2019s \u2018exercise\u2019 each day was like being released from solitary confinement.\n I had two very different experiences of lockdown. During Lockdown I, I was working on a print magazine, so I had to, initially, oversee production using email, the phone and WhatsApp. Of course, this also meant that nobody ever saw me, so I used the opportunity to grow a magnificent bouffant of hair, a beard you could lose a badger in as well as fat on fakeaways, cheap supermarket knock off-label beer and inactivity. However, as things inevitably shifted ready for Lockdown II, I suddenly found myself staring down the barrel of Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet where, I admit, the image of myself suddenly rearing-up on screen like a manic hobo from a dumpster-fire not only did little to boost confidence in me as a responsible, employable freelancer, but also terrified both online onlookers and myself alike.\n However, once I\u2019d managed to regentrify myself, one thing became clear: when it comes to doing business, video conferencing and collaborating was not going away, it was actually the way forward. So, having accepted the idea that I could no longer work au naturel, I sought out the tech tools to help me conference with confidence.\n And these days, those tools are available in abundance; hence why this week I\u2019ve been live-streaming my mug into the lounges, home offices and, indeed, bedrooms of friends and colleagues across the globe in a bid to test out the latest webcam tech. \n So, if you\u2019re still stuck at the \u2018Staged\u2019 stage of camera chat and want to up the ante with some top-notch video conferencing kit, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Wait\u2026 can you hear me? Did you hear any of that? Bloody hell, the mic was on mute all along\u2026\n VerdictWhen it comes to the new-normal of looming down a lens for modern meetings, who doesn\u2019t want their video visage to look every inch like they\u2019re calling in from the future? If money is no object, the no-brainer webcam system of choice is the Poly Studio P21.

{"post_date": "2022-04-07 11:04:11"}, {"article_body": "Britain is stepping up its supply of military equipment to Ukraine, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Thursday as Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s government issued a plea for \u201cweapons, weapons, weapons\u201d.\n The Cabinet minister stressed that the UK was responding to the call to supply more military hardware to Ukraine to defeat Vladimir Putin\u2019s barbaric invasion.\n Speaking at a Nato meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: \u201cIn the face of Putin\u2019s appalling aggression in Ukraine, the G7 and Nato are stepping up our efforts on sanctions and on weapons.\n \u201cThe UK is now banning all imports of Russian energy, we are sanctioning more banks and we are stepping up our supply of weapons to Ukraine.\u201d\n Britain is set to send protected mobility vehicles to Ukraine, having already supplied thousands of missiles, including anti-tank weapons.\n A Ukrainian military delegation, led by Deputy Defence Minister Volodymyr Havrylov, visited the Salisbury Plain training area earlier this week and was shown the armoured vehicles, as well as loitering munitions, which hang in the air and can then be later deployed against a target, and the high-speed Starstreak missile system which has already been sent to Ukraine.\n It comes after Ukraine on Thursday issued three pleas to Nato members to defeat Vladimir Putin\u2019s barbaric invasion: \u201cWeapons, weapons, weapons\u201d.\n Ahead of the high-level talks in Brussels, the country\u2019s foreign minister stressed more military equipment was vital to prevent \u201cenormous sacrifices\u201d and \u201cmore Buchas\u201d, the town near Kyiv where Russian forces are accused of killing more than 300 civilians in war crimes which included executions, mass graves and rapes.\n Dmytro Kuleba urged countries in the West to \u201cput aside their hesitations, their reluctance\u201d and to supply more arms, stressing that \u201cas weird as it may sound today weapons serve the purpose of peace\u201d.\n Issuing his appeal, he said: \u201cMy agenda is very simple, it has only three items on it.\n \u201cIt\u2019s weapons, weapons and weapons.\n \u201cWe are confident that the best way to help Ukraine now is to provide it will all necessary to contain Putin and to defeat the Russian army in Ukraine so that the war does not spill over.\u201d\n He stressed that the Ukrainian army and nation had shown the world that \u201cwe know how to fight\u201d and \u201chow to win\u201d against the Russian president\u2019s troops.\n \u201cBut without sustainable and sufficient supplies of all weapons requested by Ukraine, these wins will be accompanied with enormous sacrifices,\u201d he added.\n \u201cThe more weapons we get and the sooner they arrive in Ukraine, the more human lives will be saved, the more cities and villages will not be destructed and there will be no more Buchas.\n \u201cI call on all allies to put aside their hesitations, their reluctance, to provide Ukraine with everything it needs because as weird as it may sound but today weapons serve the purpose of peace.\u201d\n Mr Kuleba stressed that Ukraine\u2019s military needs planes, heavy air defence system, and missiles vehicles from Nato members.\n The alliance is not itself providing any weapons, amid concerns that if it did this could allow Mr Putin to seek to escalate the conflict into one between Nato and Russia, so military equipment is being provided by individual nations in bilateral arrangements, even if co-ordinated between allies.\n Britain has provided thousands of missiles, including anti-tank weapons, and is reported to be considering sending armoured vehicles which would allow Ukrainian troops to advance with better protection closer towards Russian-occupied territory.\n The Czech government is reported to have been sending Soviet era tanks which Ukrainian forces are trained in using.\n The US has already provided more than $2.3 billion (\u00a31.7 billion) of lethal assistance to Ukraine since January 2021, including a a $100 million (\u00a376 million) transfer of Javelin anti-armour missiles announced days ago, and was also reported to be training Ukrainian forces in the use of military drones.\n Meanwhile, a fifth round of European Union sanctions on Russia, including a ban on coal imports, could be agreed by the bloc on Thursday or on Friday, the EU\u2019s top diplomat Josep Borrell said.\n \u201cMaybe this afternoon, or tomorrow at the latest,\u201d he said as he arrived at the Nato meeting.\n Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who was attending the summit, announced on Wednesday that the UK was freezing the assets of Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest bank, and Credit Bank of Moscow, banning all new investment in Russia and targeting eight more oligarchs.\n The move came after Boris Johnson said the actions of Russian forces in Ukraine appeared close to \u201cgenocide\u201d.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/03/18/urnpublicidap.orga1c4ef554b004afe920e57375b842311.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Russia has

We've had non domicile status for more than 200 years. \n \"And that means that on UK income, you pay taxes here in the UK, and on foreign income, you pay taxes abroad. That's something that's been well established. \n \u201cThe Chancellor has been very transparent about this. It's always been in this declaration of interests. \n \"I think there's a lot of malicious attacks on someone who is a private citizen and is not a politician.\"\n The news comes as Mr Sunak hiked National Insurance contributions by an extra 1.25p in the pound.\n From this week millions of employees and businesses will pay more tax as the country faces a cost of living crisis, with increasing energy and food bills and rising inflation. \n Ms Murthy, a fashion designer who married Mr Sunak in 2009, was born in India and holds Indian citizenship. The country does not allow its nationals to hold dual citizenship. \n She said she pays all the tax that she is legally required to in the UK.\n Ms Murthy\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cAkshata Murthy is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents\u2019 home. \n \u201cIndia does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously.\u201d\n Ms Murthy has lived in the UK for nine years and will automatically be deemed domiciled after six more, meaning she will have to begin paying taxes on all her income. \n Her billionaire father N.R Narayana Murthy founded the IT services company, Infosys, which is one of India's biggest firms. Ms Murthy, 42, is reported to own a little under 1 per cent of the shares of Infosys, which are said to have a value of more than \u00a3500m. \n She will have have received more than \u00a311 million in dividends from the company in the past tax year. But her non-dom tax status means she would not have had to pay UK tax on the dividend at a rate of 38.1 per cent.\n Ms Murthy also has interests in several companies in the UK. \n Last month Digme Fitness, a London boutique Ms Murthy had invested in and was a director of, collapsed leaving the taxpayer to pick up its debts of \u00a3415,000.

But the judge had revealed the basis for the dispute in an earlier ruling, allowing publicity to correct misinformation that had been leaked from within the government.\n Making his decision, the judge said the name and image of X would be blocked from publication, while other aspects of his identity may also be included in the interim injunction.\n The government said during the dispute that it does not object to the BBC making allegations about a source\u2019s behaviour, but believes naming the man known as X was wrong.\n In a statement issued after the ruling, the BBC said the judgment did not prevent it from reporting \u201ckey elements\u201d of its story once restrictions are determined.\n A spokesperson for the broadcaster said: \u201cThis is not the judgment we had hoped for, but it is important to understand what it does and does not mean.\n \u201cWhile the judgment prevents the BBC from identifying X, by showing his picture or naming him, it does not prevent the BBC from reporting key elements of the story, which we will do once the precise restrictions are determined.\n \u201cWe expect these restrictions to be clarified next week.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/10/183ab7f13dc168d32cd81ee3d133a76eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5NDEwMTQ4-2.49757492.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "BBC blocked by High Court from reporting identity of \u2018MI5 informant\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/02/f323fcce097589ace337769f0c5f20ffY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzUzMTY5-2.22581002.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "High Court to rule on bid for injunction to block BBC story over \u2018MI5 informant\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/10/0300ce1b9804b0f846c59058f710b9cfY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5NDEwNzU4-2.65896959.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "UK households \u2018face record \u00a3900 income hit this year\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/08/09/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "3 housing developments property hunters should know about"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/london-tube-underground-passenger-numbers-covid-pandemic-b992997.html?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=section_banner&itm_campaign=breaking-news-ticker&itm_content=4", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Easter holiday rush sends Tube passenger numbers close to pre-pandemic levels"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 07 April 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 09:57:41"}, {"article_body": "The start of the Easter holidays took Tube passengers numbers to their highest rate for more than two years, it can be revealed.\n The number of journeys on the London Underground last Sunday hit 87 per cent of \u201cnormal\u201d pre-pandemic levels, equating to 1.72m trips.\n Bus passenger numbers on Sunday reached 83 per cent of levels seen in 2019, while both the Tube and bus networks recorded 80 per cent on the Saturday, according to the Department for Transport.\n Transport for London believes the spike may have been driven by Londoners heading off on holiday or visiting relatives.

At least three provided security for recent FIFA tournaments, including the Club World Cup.\n The report states: \"Neither FIFA nor the Supreme Committee conducted adequate due diligence before contracting the three private security companies highlighted in this report and they both failed to identify in a timely manner the full range of abuses experienced by workers in order that they be effectively addressed and remedied.\n \"As a result, by the time some abuses had been identified, FIFA and its organizing partner had already benefitted from these companies\u2019 services. They were therefore directly linked to and in some cases contributed to the harms suffered by guards in these companies.\n \"They are still contracting with one of the companies, and therefore may still be directly linked or contributing to further abuse. Unless they take urgent action to strengthen their due diligence it is highly likely this will continue during the World Cup tournament itself.\"\n Tens of thousands of migrant workers are employed in the private security sector in Qatar and the report described the \"very serious abuse\" as \"systemic and structural\".\n Among the abuses of workers detailed in the report were:\n - a majority of security guards working 12-hour days, with no time off, for months and sometimes years on end\n - huge fines for mistakes at work\n - pay discrimination on the basis of nationality, race and language\n - substandard and \u201cunsanitary\u201d living conditions, with up to 10 people sharing cramped rooms\n - workers being threatened with large salary deductions if they want to take rest days\n - dangerous working conditions, with guards forced work outside without shelter in searing heat\n - half of the security companies not paying overtime at the rate required by law\n Amnesty said the abuses had been allowed to flourish by the Qatari government's failure to properly enforce the country's new reforms, and accused FIFA and its World Cup delivery partner of failing to deliver on promises \"to improve the working and living conditions\" of the country's migrant workers.\n One security guard from Bangladesh said he did not have a day off for three years, while another, from Kenya said: \u201cThey pay us by nationality. You may find a Kenyan is earning 1,300, but the same security from the Philippines gets 1,500. Tunisians, 1,700. Pay is according to nationality\u201d. \n Another said his bosses used racist stereotypes to justify harsh and discriminatory treatment. \u201cThey say \u2018you are an African, you can work 12 hours because you are strong\u2019,\" he said.\n Accounts of racial discrimination echo the findings of the UN Special Rapporteur - who visited Qatar in late 2019 - on contemporary forms of racism.\n Stephen Cockburn, Amnesty's head of economic and social justice, said: \u201cEmployers are still exploiting their workers in plain sight, and the Qatari authorities must take urgent measures to protect workers and hold abusers accountable.\n \u201cMany of the security guards we spoke to knew their employers were breaking the law but felt powerless to challenge them.\n \u201cPhysically and emotionally exhausted, workers kept reporting for duty under threat of financial penalties - or worse, contract termination or deportation.\n \u201cDespite the progress Qatar has made in recent years, our research suggests that abuses in the private security sector - which will be increasingly in demand during the World Cup - remain systematic and structural.\n \u201cWith the World Cup just months away, FIFA must focus on doing more to prevent abuses in the inherently perilous private security sector, or see the tournament further marred by abuse.\n \u201cMore broadly, FIFA must also use its leverage to pressure Qatar to better implement its reforms and enforce its laws. Time is fast running out - if better practices are not established now, abuses will continue long after fans have gone home.\u201d\n As part of a lengthy statement in response to the report, a FIFA spokesperson said: \"FIFA is steadfast in its commitment to ensure respect for internationally recognised human rights across all its operations and events in accordance with FIFA\u2019s Human Rights Policy and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. FIFA does not accept any abuse of workers by companies involved in the preparation and delivery of the FIFA World Cup 2022...\n \"As part of its regular and ongoing engagement with Amnesty International in relation to the upcoming World Cup, FIFA has provided detailed information about the cases mentioned in their report and the corrective measures that have been applied with the companies involved.\"\n In response to the allegations, Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Labour said last month that they \u201cdo not represent underlying issues with the robust system Qatar has introduced\", and that the prevalence of rule-breaking by companies is in decline.\n The Supreme Committee meanwhile stated that \u201ca programme of the scale of the SCs, which is unique even from an international perspective, will always have contractors who will try to bypass the system\u201d.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

call for the West to quickly and decisively supply more weapons to Ukraine.\n For years, the UK and other European nations have sought to keep on engaging with Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime despite its numerous acts of aggression including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the 2018 Novichok poisonings in Salisbury.\n But the Foreign Secretary stressed Mr Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, where his forces have committed atrocities widely condemned as war crimes with thousands of civilians killed, meant this policy now had to be ditched.\n \u201cThe age of engagement with Russia is over,\u201d she was due to say.\n \u201cWe need a new approach to security in Europe based on resilience, defence and deterrence.\u201d\n The 1997 Nato-Russia Founding Act provided the formal basis for bilateral relations with Moscow, including by establishing the Nato-Russia Permanent Joint Council as a forum for consultation and co-operation.\n However, Ms Truss was expected to brand this as now \u201cdead\u201d and that it represented an out-dated approach to relations with the Kremlin.\n She also warned against raising hopes too much from Russian troops, having suffered heavy losses, being forced to pull back from around Kyiv and other parts of northern Ukraine.\n \u201cThere is no time for false comfort,\u201d she was expected to stress, as more details of the horrors committed by Russian troops in Bucha, near Kyiv, and other towns and cities are emerging.\n She was due to add: \u201cRussia is not retreating, but regrouping and repositioning to push harder in the East and South of Ukraine.\u201d\n The Cabinet minister was also set to call for the West to rapidly ramp up support to Ukraine, including by giving Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s military the weapons it needs to fight for the Russian president\u2019s invasion to fail, strengthening sanctions, and boosting defences so there are no \u201csecurity vacuums\u201d at the edge of Nato, such as in eastern Europe.\n

Flight numbers were drastically reduced as countries closed borders in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus.\n Meanwhile ongoing problems with Covid-related staff absences are putting operations at airports under strain, the AOA warned\n Karen Dee, chief executive of the AOA, which represents numerous airports including Heathrow, said at peak time passengers \u201cmay not have the experience they are used to\u201d.\n She said airports were working hard to recruit more staff in the run-up to the Easter holidays, and were \u201cworking with the UK government to resolve any delays in the necessary checks before staff can start work\u201d.\n The AOA has asked travellers to arrive early for flights due to longer check-in waits and has also urged people to make sure they have any Covid-related documents needed for their destination.\n Holiday bookings jumped with trips planned for Easter after UK Covid travel tests were scrapped.\n However, airports have said they are operating in a very tight labour market and are trying to keep up with rising demands following the sharp drops in people travelling abroad over the past two years.\n Kevin O\u2019Reilly, of the specialist aviation and airport recruitment company One Resourcing, said there were not enough ground staff including baggage handlers and cleaners.\n He added: \u201cA huge number of people left the aviation industry due to the pandemic and whilst many have come back, many have found alternative positions in other sectors and do not want to risk returning to work in an industry that made them redundant. \n \u201cNow there\u2019s a bounce-back from having no people travelling, to suddenly everyone wanting travel.\n \u201cRecruitment at airports doesn\u2019t happen overnight, people must go through a thorough security vetting process to get an airside pass.\u201d\n He said some other jobs were tempting workers away from the industry, and some EU nationals had left after Brexit.\n Manchester Airport has already blamed staff shortages on long passenger queues in recent weeks, ahead of the busier Easter break.\n It warned further problems were likely as the airport struggled with increasing demand after \u201cdramatically scaling back\u201d operations during the pandemic.\n Meanwhile Heathrow has estimated that demand for flights over the summer holidays could reach 85% of pre-pandemic levels.\n It said it would need to gear up to meet this demand, as airlines and airports did not yet have the capacity to fulfil that number of bookings. \n Britain\u2019s largest airport added it was \u201cparticularly concerned over Border Force\u2019s ability to scale up\u201d.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

times in the UK\u2019s favourite sunshine destination in time for the first busy holiday period of the year.\n But Spanish Health Minister Carolina Darias told regional officials on Wednesday the government was not planning on approving the lifting of their mandatory status in public spaces indoors like restaurants and hotels until April 19.\n Their mandatory use indoors is expect to end between April 21 or 22 when the new ruling is published in an Official State Bulletin.\n They are expected to remain obligatory after that date only in hospitals, retirement homes and on public transport.\n Easter Sunday this year falls on April 17 and most British families heading out to Spain this year will have returned home by the time the new rules on face masks come into force.\n Face masks became mandatory in all public spaces in Spain on May 20 two years ago, with their obligatory use outdoors only being lifted in February after restrictions were reintroduced around Christmas.\n Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez, addressing members of his left-wing PSOE party at the start of last month, said: \u201cWe have the lowest cumulative rate of coronavirus right now in Europe and soon, very soon, when our Health Minister says so, we\u2019ll be able to remove the mandatory status of face masks indoors.\u201d\n Experts in areas like the Costa Blanca, which includes the popular holiday resort of Benidorm, reacted by putting a timeline on the move of between three and five weeks.\n The use of face masks in public spaces indoors in Spain remains the most visible sign of the coronavirus pandemic.\n Virtually all other restrictions put in place at the height of the health crisis have already been lifted.\n Some experts have said they would prefer to see the current face masks rules remain in place until after the summer.\n The move to banish them from most parts of everyday life will be welcomed by many parents whose young children have had to wear them at school for hours on end for the last two years.\n Many Spaniards still use them outdoors despite the fact they are not obliged to do so.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

Lavrov\u2019s wife and daughter will also be targeted by the sanctions from the US.\n US President Joe Biden said the sanctions were a direct response to the killings of civilians in Bucha.\n He tweeted: \u201cI made clear that Russia would pay a severe and immediate price for its atrocities in Bucha. Today, along with our Allies and partners, we\u2019re announcing a new round of devastating sanctions.\u201d\n Sanctions have been targeting politicians, oligarchs and other figures within the Russian president\u2019s circle.\n The US and the UK have hit Russia\u2019s largest bank Sberbank with sanctions.\n In a statement, the White House said: \u201cThe United States, with the G7 and the European Union, will continue to impose severe and immediate economic costs on the Putin regime for its atrocities in Ukraine, including in Bucha.\n \u201cWe will document and share information on these atrocities and use all appropriate mechanisms to hold accountable those responsible.\n \u201cAs one part of this effort, the United States is announcing devastating economic measures to ban new investment in Russia, and impose the most severe financial sanctions on Russia\u2019s largest bank and several of its most critical state-owned enterprises and on Russian government officials and their family members.\u201d\n Also, Putin\u2019s daughters are expected to be subject to EU asset freezes and travel bans this week after Mr Putin\u2019s forces provoked global outrage after evidence of the massacre of citizens in Bucha. \n Ambassadors from the bloc will sign off the proposals on Wednesday. \n Ms Vorontsova runs a healthcare investment project while Ms Tikhonova is head of an artificial intelligence institute at Moscow State University. It is unclear whether either have assets outside of Russia. \n Earlier this week, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Russia\u2019s atrocities in Bucha \u201ccannot and will not be left unanswered\u201d. \n Other proposed EU sanctions would ban buying Russian coal, prevent Russian ships from entering EU ports and suspend nearly \u20ac20 billion worth of trade. \n The bloc has been divided on imposing curbs on Russian energy as it obtains about a third of its natural gas from the country, but Ms von der Leyen stressed that Europe must seek alternative energy sources. \n She said sanctions against four key Russian banks, including the second-largest, VTB, would see them \u201ctotally cut off from the market\u201d. \n Further sanctions will cover quantum computers and transportation equipment to \u201cdegrade Russia\u2019s technological base and industrial capacity\u201d, she added. \n Germany has ruled out an immediate embargo on gas \u2013 meaning an EU-wide decision cannot be approved unanimously.\n It follows an impassioned address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to the United Nations Security Council in which he called for fresh sanctions in response to reports of Russian war crimes. \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/17/06165919-2372ec6f-e62b-49c4-9724-16a8d0edb0d7.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75",

call for the West to quickly and decisively supply more weapons to Ukraine.\n For years, the UK and other European nations have sought to keep on engaging with Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime despite its numerous acts of aggression including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the 2018 Novichok poisonings in Salisbury.\n But the Foreign Secretary stressed Mr Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, where his forces have committed atrocities widely condemned as war crimes with thousands of civilians killed, meant this policy now had to be ditched.\n \u201cThe age of engagement with Russia is over,\u201d she was due to say.\n \u201cWe need a new approach to security in Europe based on resilience, defence and deterrence.\u201d\n The 1997 Nato-Russia Founding Act provided the formal basis for bilateral relations with Moscow, including by establishing the Nato-Russia Permanent Joint Council as a forum for consultation and co-operation.\n However, Ms Truss was expected to brand this as now \u201cdead\u201d and that it represented an out-dated approach to relations with the Kremlin.\n She also warned against raising hopes too much from Russian troops, having suffered heavy losses,

by Russian troops in Bucha, near Kyiv, and other towns and cities are emerging.\n She was due to add: \u201cRussia is not retreating, but regrouping and repositioning to push harder in the East and South of Ukraine.\u201d\n The Cabinet minister was also set to call for the West to rapidly ramp up support to Ukraine, including by giving Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s military the weapons it needs to fight for the Russian president\u2019s invasion to fail, strengthening sanctions, and boosting defences so there are no \u201csecurity vacuums\u201d at the edge of Nato, such as in eastern Europe.\n She was also due to call for a rethink of support for countries \u201ccaught in the web of Russian influence\u201d such as Georgia, Moldova, Sweden and Finland.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

foreign income.\n The Independent reported Akshata Murthy, who is believed to be worth hundreds of billions of pounds, held non-dom status.\n This means her permanent home is considered outside of the UK and, although she is still liable for UK tax on income made in this country, she does not have to pay UK tax on foreign income unless it is brought into the UK.\n The newspaper claims the status could have saved the Chancellor\u2019s wife millions of pounds in tax on foreign earnings but a spokeswoman for Ms Murthy said she has always paid UK taxes on her UK income.\n The non-dom status is lawful and it is understood Ms Murthy pays foreign taxes on her overseas income.\n But Labour said: \u201cThe Chancellor has imposed tax hike after tax hike on the British people.\n \u201cIt is staggering that, at the same time, his family may have been benefitting from tax reduction schemes. This is yet another example of the Tories thinking it is one rule for them, another for everyone else.\n \u201cRishi Sunak must now urgently explain how much he and his family have saved on their own tax bill at the same time he was putting taxes up for millions of working families and choosing to leave them \u00a32,620 a year worse off.\u201d\n A spokeswoman for Ms Murthy confirmed she held non-dom status and said: \u201cAkshata Murthy is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parent\u2019s home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously.\n \u201cSo, according to British law, Ms Murthy is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.\u201d\n It is understood Mr Sunak declared his wife\u2019s tax status when he became a minister in 2018 and the Treasury was also aware so that any potential conflicts could be managed.\n Ms Murthy is listed on LinkedIn as being director of capital and private equity firm Catamaran Ventures, gym chain Digme Fitness, and gentlemen\u2019s outfitters New and Lingwood.\n She is also reported to hold a 0.91% stake in Infosys, which was founded by her now billionaire father.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/07/09/09e73492a9ce64b480868a95c225375bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5NDA3NzY1-2.66247047.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Sunak\u2019s family accused of \u2018sheltering\u2019 from UK tax with wife\u2019s non-dom status"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/19/2476d19e1a6ec6f99344ebc2e1fe96e9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzU2MzA1-2.61626526.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Business secretary forced to defend Rishi Sunak\u2019s wife over tax status"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/12/2ca1b818b885d8a1c7714f4946325df5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzMwNDcz-2.66244964.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Johnson says putting up tax to fund NHS is \u2018unquestionably right\u2019"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/24/12/ANTALYA%201.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Antalya: a stunning destination for fans of the great outdoors"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/06/19/2476d19e1a6ec6f99344ebc2e1fe96e9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MzU2MzA1-2.61626526.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=2303%3A1231%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Rishi Sunak\u2019s wife has defended her non-domicile status </p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/comment/tenner-bring-own-birthday-cake-cakeage-restaurant-london-b992767.html?itm_source=Internal&itm_channel=section_trending_article_component&itm_campaign=editors_picks&itm_content=1", "page_details": [{"post_title": "A tenner to bring my own birthday cake?

Today, along with our Allies and partners, we\u2019re announcing a new round of devastating sanctions.\u201d\n Sanctions have been targeting politicians, oligarchs and other figures within the Russian president\u2019s circle.\n The US and the UK have hit Russia\u2019s largest bank Sberbank with sanctions.\n In a statement, the White House said: \u201cThe United States, with the G7 and the European Union, will continue to impose severe and immediate economic costs on the Putin regime for its atrocities in Ukraine, including in Bucha.\n \u201cWe will document and share information on these atrocities and use all appropriate mechanisms to hold accountable those responsible.\n \u201cAs one part of this effort, the United States is announcing devastating economic measures to ban new investment in Russia, and impose the most severe financial sanctions on Russia\u2019s largest bank and several of its most critical state-owned enterprises and on Russian government officials and their family members.\u201d\n Also, Putin\u2019s daughters are expected to be subject to EU asset freezes and travel bans this week after Mr Putin\u2019s forces provoked global outrage after evidence of the massacre of citizens in Bucha. \n Ambassadors from the bloc will sign off the proposals on Wednesday. \n Ms Vorontsova runs a healthcare investment project while Ms Tikhonova is head of an artificial intelligence institute at Moscow State University.

A clause in the agreement guarantees a minimum increase of two per cent.\n The current rate of CPI inflation is 6.2 per cent.\n Mr Khan increased Tube and bus fares by 4.8 per cent at the start of March.\n A Tube driver\u2019s full-time annual salary is \u00a358,949. Station staff have a broad range of roles and grades but most earn less than this amount. \n Lib-Dem assembly member Caroline Pidgeon said: \u201cWhether it is the setting of fares or pay rises it makes no sense to use a baseline of just one month\u2019s rate of inflation. A much better way of setting fares and wages for TfL staff needs to be found.\u201d\n Keith Prince, GLA Conservatives transport spokesman, said: \u201cSurely savvy business planning involves factoring in and mitigating risk so that \u2018nearly bankrupt\u2019 TfL doesn\u2019t have to accommodate a pay award of 8.4 per cent per London Underground staff member.\n \u201cThe mayor was advised to put a cap on the RPI figure, but he refused to do so. It\u2019s also a travesty that London continues to be held to ransom by striking workers on a very, very good deal.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/11/23/10/MS%20Marble%20Arch.JPG?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Sadiq Khan criticised for refusing to block demolition of Marble Arch M&S"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/12/09_Jan_JS_London_54.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "24-hour Tube strikes cost TfL \u00a313 million in lost fares"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/13/2de9f0e2aa020d7b20046197d3a34e84Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4NTUyNjYx-2.65645264.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "New Met Police Commissioner to be appointed in the summer"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/04/11/Mugla_Dalyan_Canal_morass_6720x4480px%20%281%29.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Why you need to explore T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Dalaman region for yourself "}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/mayor/sadiq-khan-defends-pay-rise-london-underground-staff-tube-b990287.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Sadiq Khan defends bumper pay hike for London Underground staff after row over Tube strikes"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 24 March 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-03-24 17:54:25"}, {"article_body": "Sadiq Khan has defended the bumper pay rise being awarded to 15,000 Tube staff from next month after facing criticism for failing to prevent two mass strikes on the London Underground.\n Transport for London confirmed on Thursday that Tube drivers and station staff will receive an 8.4 per cent annual rise, coming into effect between April and June.\n Tube drivers earn almost \u00a359,000 a year - putting them in line for a rise of almost \u00a35,000.\n No part of the increase \u2013 which will cost TfL about \u00a3100m to implement \u2013 will be deferred.\n It is the final year of a four-year pay deal struck between TfL and the Tube unions, which awarded Underground staff the RPI rate of inflation for February, announced on Wednesday as 8.2 per cent, plus an additional 0.2 percentage points.\n At Mayor\u2019s Question Time on Thursday morning, Mr Khan was asked by Tony Devenish, a Tory member of the London Assembly, what action he was taking in the wake of two Tube strikes that \u201ccrippled\u201d the capital on March 1 and 3.\n Mr Khan, who previously promised \u201czero days of strikes\u201d, described the strikes as \u201cdisappointing and frustrating\u201d and said: \u201cThe action was the first network-wide strike to take place since I became mayor in 2016.\n \u201cThe previous mayor [Boris Johnson] presided over five network-wide strikes.\u201d\n But Mr Devenish replied: \u201cThe network completely shut down on March 1 to 3, particularly the Tuesday and the Thursday, and you say it\u2019s \u2018disappointing\u2019.\n \u201cI asked you what are you going to do to end the Tube strike action that is crippling London? You haven\u2019t given me an answer.\n \u201cYou have just given them an 8.4 per cent pay rise.

Camden and Islington have also seen high levels of demand, with wait lists of 7,307 and 6,963 respectively.\n A coalition of clean air organisations, led by Clean Cities Campaign, is calling on Londoners to share images of the awkward places they have to store their bikes, using the hashtag #ThisIsAwkward on social media.

I am determined to stick to my promises. It will open by June 30.\u201d\n It is highly unlikely that Crossrail will be ready to open before the \u201cpurdah\u201d period prior for the May 5 local elections starts in a fortnight, on March 28.\n Purdah, also known as a period of \u201cheightened sensitivity\u201d, runs for five working weeks and prevents announcements being made by public bodies that could influence the outcome of elections.\n Mr Byford said it would be possible to \u201ctechnically\u201d open the line during purdah \u2013 but not to have a \u201cglitzy\u201d launch attended by Mayor Sadiq Khan and other politicians. This means that the actual opening is unlikely to happen until after the local elections.\n Nine of the 10 new stations are complete but there remain concerns about the reliability of the \u00a31bn fleet of new trains.\n Mr Byford has insisted that the Elizabeth line, as Crossrail will be renamed when services start operating, performs \u201cflawlessly\u201d from day one and will not allow it to open until he is certain that will be the case.\n However problems have been occurring on the \u201cboundary\u201d between two signalling systems at Stratford, where electrical interference is believed to be the cause of the emergency braking system being applied automatically on the trains.\n Mr Byford said there were no safety issues but said this disrupted a smooth service, as the trains needed to be reset. A meeting with manufacturers Alstom is planned for Monday night.\n \u201cThe train isn\u2019t as reliable as I needed it to be,\u201d he said. He said a \u201cnumber of weeks\u201d running the trains \u201cup and down, up and down\u201d were required to be sure that all the glitches had been erased. A final software upgrade also needs to be installed.\n Mr Byford said that Bond Street station remained three months behind schedule \u2013 meaning it was unlikely to be open when Crossrail opens.\n It is one of two stations serving Oxford Street. Mr Byford revealed he had \u201cruled out\u201d a plan to open half the station.\n Only using one rather than both ticket halls at Bond Street which would prove more costly and would add to the delays, he told the assembly.\n This means that trains will initially run through the station without stopping \u2013 preventing an interchange with the Jubilee line, and meaning that Oxford Street-bound passengers will initially have to use Tottenham Court Road.\n Mr Byford said the \u201ctrial operations\u201d dress rehearsal phase \u2013 which involves thousands of volunteers being evacuated from the trains and stations \u2013 was \u201cvirtually complete\u201d. \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/03/13/newFile-10.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75",

buses: not stopping at bus stops and banning cars from key roads"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 15 March 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-03-15 15:55:27"}, {"article_body": "Express buses that skip bus stops and banning cars and taxis from key roads are among the plans revealed on Friday to speed up London\u2019s bus fleet.\n Transport for London wants to make journeys 10 per cent quicker at a time average bus speeds have again fallen below 10mph due to the increase in car use and number of home delivery vehicles.\n TfL also pledged in its bus action plan to eliminate all bus deaths and serious injuries by the end of the decade, despite a spate of fatal collisions involving pedestrians, including at Victoria station, Shoreditch and Regent Street.\n The plan promises 25km of new bus lanes by 2025 and the possibility of more streets being converted in the style of Tottenham Court Road, where only buses and bikes are allowed 8am-7pm, Monday to Saturday.\n A \u201climited stop\u201d bus service on Old Kent Road is set to be considered this year after the success of the X140 between Harrow bus station and Heathrow, where it serves only around one in three stops alongside the conventional 140 service.\n TfL wants to accelerate the electrification of the 9,000-vehicle bus fleet but says \u00a3500m of help from the Government would be needed for this to happen by 2030, rather than the 2034 current target date.\n Its vision is for more buses like the electric vehicles recently introduced on route 63 that links King\u2019s Cross and Honor Oak Park.\n However its hopes of improving bus journey times will be made more difficult by a four per cent reduction in bus mileage, being implemented to save cash.\n TfL\u2019s action plan states: \u201cWe believe that, on balance, these reductions will not significantly damage our ability to attract people back to our network or the Mayor\u2019s and Government\u2019s shared policy objectives.\n \u201cHowever, at this point further reductions would not be supported by evidence and could put London\u2019s recovery in jeopardy.\n \u201cWe need to welcome our customers back, encourage them to use the bus for more of their trips and attract car drivers to use the bus.\u201d\n TfL says the changes on Tottenham Court Road \u201cimproved journey times on four bus routes, as well as reducing congestion across the area\u201d.\n It announced last December that the majority of bus lanes on London\u2019s red routes would be converted to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n The number of people being killed or seriously injured by a bus has fallen from 251 in 2017, including eight deaths, to 128 in 2020, including seven deaths. However the 2020 figures are artificially low due to the pandemic causing a big reduction in journeys.\n TfL aims to improve bus safety by retro-fitting \u201cintelligent speed assistance\u201d that limits speeds, tackling fatigue in bus drivers, with \u201cfatigue detection technology\u201d being rolled out to 500 buses by the end of 2022.\n Louise Cheeseman, TfL\u2019s director of buses, said: \u201cWe are excited to set out our bus strategy for the rest of this decade, which is all about creating a bus service reflective of our customers and their evolving needs, supporting a sustainable recovery from the pandemic, making London a net zero city by 2030 and improving people\u2019s safety and wellbeing.\u202f\n \u201cBuses are already an efficient, convenient form of public transport and London has the largest green bus fleet in western Europe, but we need to raise the bar. Ultimately, it\u2019s about making the bus the natural choice over the car.\u201d\n Emma Gibson, chief executive at London TravelWatch, which represents passengers, said: \u201cTfL is spot-on in setting out what needs to be done to get more people using the bus. Making it quicker to get from A to B is key to this, and improving journey times is a win-win as it saves TfL money which can be re-invested in bus routes, particularly in outer London.\n \u201cBut getting more people using the bus also requires protecting existing routes, and supporting this and the wider ambitions of the Bus Action Plan can\u2019t be done without long-term funding.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/01/09/AFP_32484VJ.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Easter weekend: Which TfL lines are closed and how do I get to Heathrow?"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/05/07/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Easter weekend Tube chaos as TfL announces widespread closures"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/26/10/4f2b03bc59a643f766bf5fb556c774a5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4Mzc1Njc2-2.34275721.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Surge hiring: Uber seeks 20,000 drivers as TfL grants new licence"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/02/13/Screenshot%202022-03-02%20at%2012.06.10.png?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Can remote prostate cancer monitoring improve men\u2019s quality of life?"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/11/12/63%20bus%20inside.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=8093%3A5282%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Raising the sunroof: Inside the 63 bus</p>"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/11/13/KSI%20graphic.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=615%3A833%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>KSI: The number of people killed or seriously injured in bus collisions </p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/transport/ulez-expansion-sadiq-khan-backlash-greater-london-tory-mp-b986959.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Ulez expansion: Sadiq Khan \u2018faces political backlash\u2019 against plans to extend zone across Greater London"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 11 March 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-03-11 17:14:48"}, {"article_body": "Sadiq Khan is facing a backlash from Tory MPs against his plans to extend the ultra-low emission zone to the Greater London boundary.\n The Mayor announced last week that he wanted to expand the \u00a312.50-a-day Ulez from the suburbs \u2014 it currently is in force up to the North and South Circular roads \u2014 across all 33 London boroughs by the end of next year.\n But Tory MP for Orpington Gareth Bacon described the proposal - dubbed the \u201cGL-Ulez\u201d - as \u201cmadness\u201d and warned it would be fiercely opposed by a number of MPs representing outer London constituencies.\n He said his constituency did not have the same pollution or congestion as inner London and accused Mr Khan of simply trying to generate additional funds for TfL, which has seen its fares income collapse due to the pandemic.\n Mr Bacon, who has launched a petition opposing the expansion, said people were \u201chorrified\u201d at the prospect - including some Labour MPs.\n \u201cI think my constituents will be appalled,\u201d he told the Standard. \u201cThere is no justification on air quality grounds for expanding the Ulez.

A \u00a361m scrappage scheme set up for the suburban expansion of the Ulez last October was oversubscribed and ran out of cash after helping about 14,000 people.\n Mr Khan, in announcing his aim to expand the Ulez, abandoned alternative plans to impose a \u00a33.50-a-day Greater London boundary charge on out-of-town motorists or a \u00a32-a-day \u201cclean air charge\u201d on all petrol and diesel vehicles.\n Mr Bacon said this had given him hope that the Greater London Ulez could also be defeated. \u201cThis will cut cross-party and not have a huge amount of support,\u201d he said.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not just people who live inside Greater London who will be affected by this. The economic and social harm is very significant\u00a0 at a time we are trying to recover from the pandemic. \n \u201cIf you have got an older vehicle - even one as \u2018new\u2019 as a 2013/14 diesel - it\u2019s going to cost you \u00a34,500 a year to use that car if you come in every day. That is before taxing it or putting fuel in it.\u201d\n City Hall claims that emissions of toxic air from road transport in outer London are not reducing at the same speed as in central and inner London, highlighting the need for action.\n It published Londonwide data in January showing that Bromley, which includes Orpington, had the fifth highest level of PM2.5 particulate emissions, the sixth highest nitrogen oxides emissions and seventh highest CO2 emissions from road transport in 2019.\n A mayoral spokesman said: \u201cOnly people driving the most polluting cars will have to pay the charge and the Mayor has committed to as big a scrappage scheme as is feasible in order to help Londoners most in need.\n \u201cToo often we have seen measures to tackle air pollution and the climate emergency delayed because it\u2019s viewed as being too hard or politically inconvenient, but the mayor is not willing to put off making the changes that are in his power here in London.\u201d \n A London Labour spokesman said: \"The Tories have opposed every measure the mayor has taken to reduce air pollution and congestion in London. \n \u201cRather than trying to score political points, the Tories in London should be backing measures that will help protect the health of Londoners they represent and calling on the Tory government to give London its fair share of funding to move to greener vehicles.\u201d \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/12/09_Jan_JS_London_54.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "24-hour Tube strikes cost TfL \u00a313 million in lost fares"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/13/2de9f0e2aa020d7b20046197d3a34e84Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4NTUyNjYx-2.65645264.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "New Met Police Commissioner to be appointed in the summer"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/11/13/0a3849c7ecdfc6ed66b123eccb515e86Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ0NjcxNTY2-2.55734824.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Patel orders review into way Khan ousted Dame Cressida as Met boss"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/01/28/12/Turkaegean_Orange_11648x8736px.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Why the Turkish Aegean needs to be on your holiday radar"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/transport/tube-strikes-passenger-numbers-london-tfl-travel-chaos-rmt-sadiq-khan-b986945.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "London Tube strikes caused passenger numbers to plummet to just 4% of normal levels"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 09 March 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-03-09 15:54:56"}, {"article_body": "The full impact of the two Tube strikes last week has been revealed, with figures showing that passenger numbers fell to only four per cent of normal levels.\n The 160,000 journeys recorded on the first of the two strike days was the lowest number of daily trips on the Tube since the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in May 2020, when the capital was in lockdown.\n Data published by the Department for Transport on Wednesday also revealed that the RMT walk-out also resulted in fewer journeys on each day following a strike day.\n This was a consequence of Transport for London\u2019s inability to run a full service during the morning peak hours \u2013 and will have exacerbated its losses in fares income caused by the two 24-hour stoppages.\n The RMT had called its 10,000 members out on strike in protest at the axing of up to 600 station staff jobs and feared changes to pensions and working conditions as TfL strives to comply with Government demands to save millions and break even by the end of 2022/23.\n TfL chiefs called the action \u201ccompletely unnecessary\u201d but RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said his members were \u201cnot prepared to take a hammering\u201d to pay for the funding crisis at TfL.\n More than 200 stations were closed, including all four stations serving Oxford Street. \n Weekly figures from the DfT show the number of Tube journeys on both Tuesday March 1 and Thursday March 3 reached four per cent of normal, or pre-pandemic, levels.\n This equated to 160,000 Tube journeys on the Tuesday and 170,000 journeys on the Thursday - compared with 2.58m and 2.83m respectively seven days earlier.\n On Wednesday March 2, they returned to 52 per cent of normal and on Friday March 4 to 54 per cent of normal \u2013 both well down on the 67 per cent figure seen on both days a week earlier.\n The data also shows that bus passenger numbers on the Tube strike days were 84 per cent \u2013 up on the 77 and 79 per cent on the corresponding days a week earlier.\n This is confirmation of the battle many commuters faced in trying to board a bus to make their way to work or back home in the evening.\n TfL was able to run some services on each of the strike days but these were largely limited to outlying sections of the Underground, where lines run above ground and stations can be opened with few staff present.\n No further strikes have been announced by the RMT but more action is likely, with the next potential flashpoint coming after the review into the TfL pension scheme that is being headed by former TUC chief Sir Brendan Barber is submitted to the Government by March 31.\n The figures could strengthen the hand of Tube unions in opposing any changes to pensions as they indicate how walkouts can bring the Underground to a near total shutdown.\n A TfL spokesperson said: \u201cWe appreciate that travelling around London during the recent strikes was difficult for everyone and we are very sorry to all those caught up in last week\u2019s disruption. Strikes like these have a huge impact on people\u2019s lives and they also damage the businesses that have been trying so hard to get back on their feet after two hugely challenging years.\n \u201cDuring the strike, our bus services had an increased ridership of 85 per cent of pre-pandemic levels a 13 per cent increase from the same day the preceding week and we also had a 486 per cent increase in Santander Cycles hires compared to the same day in March 2019.\n \u201cWe know our customers and our city deserve better than this, which is why we\u2019re urging the RMT to work constructively with us so we can find a resolution to this dispute.\u201d \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/09/10/Oxford%20Circus%20RMT.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=640%3A480%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>RMT members on the picket line at Oxford Circus station on March 3</p>"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/03/14/INDUSTRY%20Tube%20%2008452542.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Mayor Sadiq Khan defends bumper pay hike for London Underground staff"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/01/09/AFP_32484VJ.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Easter weekend: Which TfL lines are closed and how do I get to Heathrow?"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/05/07/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Easter weekend Tube chaos as TfL announces widespread closures"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/08/09/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "3 housing developments property hunters should know about"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/09/10/TCR.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=640%3A480%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Tottenham Court Road station was one of four on Oxford Street that was shut by the Tube strike</p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/london-tube-underground-strike-disruption-today-friday-how-to-get-around-sadiq-khan-tfl-rmt-b985999.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "1/60London Underground Tube Strike: March 2022"}, {"author_container": "By    Sarah Harvey Ross Lydall @RossLydall 04 March 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-03-04 17:21:31"}, {"article_body": "Disruption continues across the London underground network on Friday after a strike on Thursday brought the tube to a standstill.\n Just after 7am only the Central and Victoria lines were running a normal service. The Bakerloo line had managed to get a partial service running, with the rest of the underground network was suspended. The DLR was part suspended. The London Overground, which has been operating throughout the strikes, was operating a good service.\n By 10am most lines were operating a good service, with minor delays on the District and Circle, Hammersmith & City, Jubille and Metropolitan. The Piccadilly line still had severe delays.\n TfL has warned that services were unlikely to be operating at anywhere near normal until at least mid-morning.\n There was still disruption during the evening rush hour.\n At 5.15pm TfL was reporting minor delays on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines due to train cancellations and severe delays on the Waterloo & City lines due to faulty trains. A good service was reported on other lines.\n Action by the RMT again brought the Underground to a near-total standstill on Thursday, with more than 200 stations closed and rush-hour chaos as passengers tried to board packed buses, queued for Boris bikes and taxis or faced gridlock on the roads.\n RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said on Thursday his members were \u201cnot prepared to take a hammering\u201d to pay for the funding crisis at TfL that caused the staffing reductions and review of the staff pensions scheme, which costs TfL about \u00a3375\u2009million a year.\n \u201cThe

will be frustrated by this strike action, but urge them not to take it out on those who are trying to help,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWe haven\u2019t proposed any changes to pensions or terms and

600m from a Santander Cycle hire point in central London.\n Passengers can use maps on the TfL website to plan walking or cycling journeys around central London.\n Electric Scooter\n There are electric scooter rentals in some London boroughs, which is the only way to legally ride one in London.\n These boroughs are Camden, City of London, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Richmond upon Thames, Southwark, Tower Hamlets and Westminster.\n According to TfL, renting an e-scooter typically costs between \u00a33.25 and \u00a33.40 for a 15-minute journey.\n Operators charge a \u00a31 unlock fee plus 15p per minute for Dott and Tier scooters or 16p per minute for Lime, which is paid via the relevant app.\n Heathrow\n The Piccadilly line will be affected by the strike.\n TfL advises that passengers travelling to Heathrow use TfL Rail services from Paddington or third-party coach services instead.\n Night Tube strikes at weekends\n Overnight strikes on the Central and Victoria lines are taking place every Friday and Saturday until Sunday 19 June 2022.\n Passengers are advised to check the TfL website for updates before travelling.\n Travel tools\n In addition to checking updates on the TfL website, Londoners can make use of a range of travel tools to plan their journeys.\n The TfL Journey Planner helps passengers plan public transport, cycling or walking routes, whilst the Nearby page provides information on local Tube, bus, river, London Overground, DLR, TfL Rail and Santander Cycles locations.\n The TfL Go app provides users with a live map to see their route, and live updates on all bus, Tube, London Overground, DLR, TfL Rail and tram lines.\n Loading....\n Users can also check walking and cycling routes for all or part of their journey, and the app\u2019s step-free mode helps passengers plan accessible journeys - this includes information on toilet availability, platform access and live lift status.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

London \u201cboundary charge\u201d that would have required out-of-town motorists to pay \u00a33.50 a day or more to enter the capital have been ditched, the Evening Standard can reveal.\n Mayor Sadiq Khan will formally confirm on Friday that he has decided to take the radical option off the table for good after a study found it would not have been financially viable.\n The idea was first proposed in December 2020 as one way of generating \u00a3500m a year in additional income for Transport for London \n But it was dubbed \u201cCheckpoint Chigwell\u201d by Tory critics and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps made clear his opposition to the \u201cundemocratic\u201d nature of the mayor seeking to impose a tax on people living outside London who could not remove him at the ballot box\n The levy was even proposed to reach \u00a35.50 a day for drivers of more polluting vehicles.\n At the time, Mr Khan was urging the Government to devolve to City Hall the \u00a3500m a year paid in vehicle excise duty, or VED \u201ccar tax\u201d, by the capital\u2019s motorists. He threatened to impose the boundary charge if he did not get his wish.\n But after research by TfL into the feasibility of imposing the levy, Mr Khan has ditched the plan and will instead press ahead with other options \u2013 with a major announcement expected later on Friday morning.\n A well-placed source told the Standard: \u201cAfter seeing the modelled impacts versus the costs, the mayor is understood to have rejected the Greater London boundary charge.\u201d\n Susan Hall, leader of the GLA Conservatives, said the boundary charge had been a \u201cridiculous idea from the beginning\u201d.\n Mr Khan now has to decide whether to impose a levy of about \u00a32 a day on all petrol and diesel cars to drive in the capital, or extend the ultra-low emission zone for a second time \u2013 or do both.\n These options were floated by Mr Khan in January as he set out his ambition to reduce road emissions by 27 per cent by the end of the decade.\n A clean air charge would affect more than two million Londoners and prove especially controversial as motorists who recently upgraded their petrol or diesel vehicle to comply with last October\u2019s Ulez expansion to the suburbs would still have to pay \u2013 as only electric and hybrid vehicles would be exempt.\n TfL cannot impose motoring levies with the sole purpose of generating cash, but this is allowed if it is \u201cincidental\u201d to measures introduced to tackle gridlock, such as the congestion charge, or pollution, such as the Ulez.\n Mr Khan was ordered to accelerate his plans under the terms of TfL\u2019s latest Government bailout, which awarded it \u00a3200m last Friday .\n Mr Shapps told the mayor to put income-raising plans out to consultation by the end of June \u2013 effectively accelerating the timeframe for another big change to the cost of driving in London. \n"}, {"images": [{"src":

disruption today after the RMT confirmed an entire-network strike is going ahead.\n What dates and times are the Tube strikes planned and when will it end?\n The strike started at a minute past midnight and will go until a minute to midnight on Thursday.\n The RMT has ordered its 10,000 members not to show up for work, which has seen the entire Tube network suspended. \n Friday March 4 is also likely to be affected by disruptions, and morning rush hour services are expected to be \u201cseverely impacted\u201d.\n What lines will be impacted by the latest strike?\n All Tube lines will be affected by the strike as RMT members work across all London Underground lines.\n On strike days expect:\n Severe disruption to all lines and stations throughout the dayHighly likely no London Underground services will run\n These strikes are also expected to impact other forms of transportation, such as buses, which will be busier as a result.\n Services will be running on London Overground, TfL Rail, DLR, London Trams and National Rail but services will be busier than usual.\n If you are using services from stations also served by the Tube, check before you travel for possible station closures.\n Why is the RMT striking?\n Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union are striking in protest at what they regard to be a threat to jobs and pensions.\n TfL have announced plans to axe between 500 and 600 station posts and review TfL\u2019s generous pension scheme in a bid to save cash.\n An independent review commissioned by Mayor Sadiq Khan before the pandemic found that reforming the TfL pension scheme could save \u00a3100m a year from 2025.\n This has led to fears among union members that their pensions could be at risk.\n A ballot held by the RMT in December was overwhelmingly in favour of striking or taking action short of a strike if TfL introduced changes to their work benefits without consultation.\n Of the 51.7 per cent of eligible RMT members who voted, 4,900 members voted yes and only 307 voted no. \n RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \u201cOur members will be taking strike action [next week] because a financial crisis at London Underground has been deliberately engineered by the Government to drive a cuts\u2019 agenda which would savage jobs, services, safety and threaten their working conditions and pensions.\u201d\n Lynch added: \u201cThe sheer scale of that threat was confirmed in talks.\n \u201cThese are the very same transport staff praised as heroes for carrying London through Covid for nearly two years, often at serious personal risk, who now have no option but to strike to defend their livelihoods.\n \u201cThe politicians need to wake up to the fact that transport staff will not pay the price for this cynically engineered crisis.\n \u201cIn addition to the strike action RMT is co-ordinating a campaign of resistance with colleagues from other unions impacted by this threat.\u201d\n Talks at arbitration service Acas that could have seen the strikes postponed broke down last night, because according to the RMT, TfL \u201cconfirmed all the union\u2019s worst fears that nothing is off the table in terms of the threat to jobs, pensions, conditions and safety\u201d.\n What have others, including TFL, said?\n RMT\u2019s announcement is a blow to efforts to get Londoners back into the office, and comes at a time when TfL is struggling to recover from the impact of the Omicron virus.\n John Dickie, chief executive at business group London First, said: \u201cWith another strike announcement, the RMT is playing Russian roulette with the recovery yet again.\n \u201cThis is a reckless approach at time when the city needs to be pulling together to get people back to offices, restaurants, shops, theatres and more.\u201d\n TfL also emphasised that workers will not lose their jobs, and that the cuts will be made by not filling empty posts and staff who choose to leave or retire.\n TfL chief operating officer Andy Lord said: \u201cIt is extremely disappointing that the RMT has today announced strike action, as no proposals have been tabled on pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody has or will lose their jobs as a result of the proposals we have set out.\n \u201cThe devastating impact of the pandemic on TfL finances has made a programme of change urgently necessary and we need the RMT to work with us, rather than disrupting London\u2019s recovery. We\u2019re urging them to do the right thing for London, talk to us and call off this unnecessary action.\u201d\n Loading....\n The pensions review, required as a condition of a Government bailout for TfL to keep services running during the pandemic, has not come to any conclusions.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

does it cost, where and what time does it apply?"}, {"author_container": "By    Esra Arahu 03 March 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-03-03 16:32:59"}, {"article_body": "TfL announced early this week that the London Congestion Charge will return to the pre-pandemic hours of 7am - 6pm on weekdays.\n In June 2020, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan had extended weekday C-charge hours to 10pm, and increased the charge from \u00a311.50 to \u00a315, to encourage walking and cycling.\n But in order to reboot the economy following the Covid pandemic, the pre-pandemic weekday hours have been reinstated, although the price will remain at \u00a315.\n Residents\u2019 discounts, which see those living within the zone pay just 10 per cent of the Charge, are also being reinstated.\n Sadiq Khan said that these changes \u201cstrike a balance between reducing traffic and congestion and supporting London\u2019s economy and residents.\u201d\n What is the London Congestion Charge?\n Motorists are required to pay a daily fee in order to travel into certain areas of London during peak hours. \n The charge was introduced in 2003 as a way to reduce congestion in those areas, and was initially worth \u00a311.50, but the price has since been increased to \u00a315.\n Where does the Congestion Charge zone apply?\n The C-charge zone covers large areas of London, encompassing Mayfair, Marylebone, Green Park and Westminster at its most westerly edge, and out to the Barbican and City of London if heading east.\n At its northernmost point it covers Euston and St Pancras, and in south London it includes Lambeth, Waterloo, Newington, Southwark and Borough.\n Motorists can visit the TFL website to find out if a specific address is within the charge zone.\n What time is the London Congestion Charge in operation?\n The Congestion Charge is active on weekdays between the hours of 7am and 6pm, and on weekends and bank holidays from 12pm-6pm.\n However, there is no charge between Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Day bank holiday.\n Which vehicles have to pay?\n All combustion-engined cars - including hybrids - are subject to the Congestion Charge.\n Pre-2018, all alternatively-fuelled vehicles were exempt from the Congestion Charge, but since October 2021, only zero-emission vehicles have been exempt from the Congestion Charge. \n However, from December 2025, even drivers of zero-emission cars will be required to pay.\n Other exemptions do apply - vehicles recorded at the DVLA in some categories, such as two-wheeled motorbikes (and sidecars) and mopeds, do not pay a charge. A full list of exempt vehicles can be found on the TfL website.\n Reimbursements are available for local authority workers, as well as charity workers providing \u201ccertain pandemic support services in the zone\u201d. NHS patients who are vulnerable to coronavirus can also claim reimbursements.\n How do I pay?\n The charge must be paid in advance or by midnight the same day - the charge increases to \u00a317.50 if paid by midnight on the third day, and a failure to pay the charge results in a \u00a3160 fine (halved to \u00a380 if paid within 14 days).\n Payments can be made through the TfL Pay to drive in London app or online via the TfL website. Both methods offer an Auto Pay feature, which allows customers set up automatic charge payments.\n Payments can also be made by phone on weekdays between 8am and 8pm.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/31/12/7f7a836dacc95c4a693f50fa613e1c09Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4ODEwNDU0-2.66144480.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "New Ofcom chief Lord Grade admits he does not use social media"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/31/12/0da172f2ec5994375c298e21dfee3549Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4ODEwOTUz-2.65255012.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Protests planned over cost-of-living crisis and P&O sackings"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/24/14/PRI216053910.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Highest number of Covid patients in London hospitals for almost two months"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/01/31/12/MG-STK1115_Movember_Campaign_Image_Toolkit_DAVIDANDREW_PEREZ_HIRes_06%281%29.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Closing the cancer care gap "}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/20/15/congestion-charge-zone-map.gif?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=4984%3A3581%2Csmart", "alt": "<p> Congestion Charge zone </p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/london-tube-underground-strike-latest-when-does-it-end-rmt-sadiq-khan-b985469.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "1/60Tube Strike: 1st March 2022"}, {"author_container": "By    Sarah Harvey Barney Davis @BarneyDavisES Ross Lydall @RossLydall 02 March 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-03-02 17:59:54"}, {"article_body": "London commuters were on Wednesday facing another day of chaos as disruption continued across the Tube network after Tuesday\u2019s strike.\n Just after 6am the entire network was suspended with only the London Overground operating a reduced service.\n By 10.30am all lines were operating but most had delays. Services were \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d across Wednesday morning \u2013 meaning fewer services and packed trains.\n As of 4pm, five out of 11 London Underground lines were continuing to run a reduced service.\n The Bakerloo, Circle, District, Hammersmith & City and Northern lines had \u201csevere\u201d or \u201cminor\u201d delays.\n Around 19 stations, including Nine Elms, Tottenham Hale, Hendon Central and Lambeth North, were shut earlier \u201cwhile the service recovered from strike action by the RMT\u201d.\n Only East Acton remained part-closed due to the unavailability of station staff to help with step-free access.\n Londoners expressed their frustration on social media as they turned up to Tube stations to find the gates locked for the second day running.\n One commuter arriving at Archway station posted a picture of the locked gates at 6.10am, adding in a sarcastic note: \u201c I\u2019m so glad the tube strike is over and my commute was unaffected. \n \u201cThanks #TFL you are really supporting hard working Londoners.\u201d\n Another at a shut Clapham South station complained: \u201cTfL well done, strike\u2019s over and apparently this station isn\u2019t opening until an as yet unspecified time. \n \u201cNo signs, no updates, no nothing. People only have to work, no biggie.\u201d\n Twelve Underground stations, most on the Central line, remained closed at 8am including Paddington and Regents Park.\n TfL said the Victoria line was running a good service but commuters at Tottenham Hale reported that station being closed at 6.30am.\n Others in Hillingdon, which lies on both the Piccadilly and Metropolitan lines, claimed that trains were running through whilst people were locked out of the station.\n Passengers were advised to delay their journeys until later in the day. \n The disruption was caused by a number of factors, including the placement of trains and the number of staff available in the morning \u2013 with some on overlapping night shifts not having been able to start overnight.\n A near total shutdown is expected again on Thursday, the second day of the RMT\u2019s two days of action over threats to pensions and the axing of up to 600 station staff posts to save TfL cash.\n TfL said: \u201cFurther disruption is expected all day on Thursday March 3, when customers are advised to work from home if they can, and into the morning of Friday March 4, when customers should avoid early morning journeys.\u201d\u00a0 \n No further strikes have been announced by the RMT but a separate action over the rotas used to staff the Night Tube remains ongoing and is expected to continue reducing the number of trains on the Victoria and Central lines overnight on Friday and Saturday nights until June.\n On Tuesday, TfL was able to run shuttle services at the end of some lines where the stations are above ground \u2013 on the Bakerloo, Northern, Central, Piccadilly and District lines.\n However there were no trains on the Victoria, Metropolitan, Jubilee, Circle or Hammersmith and City lines in what was the worst strike since January 2017 in terms of its impact on the Underground network.\n Mayor Sadiq Khan denied he was to blame and turned his fire on the RMT.\n Thousands of early morning commuters were caught unaware by the RMT walk-out on Tuesday and were forced to cram onto buses as advice to work from home went unheeded.\n A miserable morning, with roads heavily congested, was made worse by a near five per cent rise in Transport for London fares and a 3.8 per cent hike in national rail fares.\n A Tube boss described the union as \u201cturkeys voting for Christmas\u201d and said RMT\u2019s decision to call 10,000 members out on strike would worsen TfL\u2019s already dire finances.\n Many passengers vented frustration that their commute had been hampered just as they began returning to the office following the pandemic.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

only 20 minutes on Monday as Londoners were told to prepare to work from home if they can.\n Direct talks between the RMT union and London Underground negotiators began with union sources suggesting a \u201cpolitical shift\u201d from Mayor Sadiq Khan would be needed to \u201cchange the weather\u201d.\n Transport for London sources were similarly pessimistic \u2013 saying it was difficult to respond to union concerns about pensions when no proposals to change staff benefits had been tabled.\n By 4pm on Monday, the Standard was told by union sources that the talks had lasted barely 20 minutes with \u201cno progress\u201d - meaning the strikes were still on. TfL confirmed this remained the case.\n Earlier on Monday morning, TfL had revealed that Tube ridership had reached 85 per cent of pre-pandemic levels last Saturday \u2013 and 90 per cent at times. Weekday levels are two-thirds of normal.\n It said the two 24-hour strikes \u2013 which are due to start at a minute past midnight on Tuesday and Thursday \u2013 would damage the city\u2019s economic recovery.\n Passengers were urged to work from home \u2013 alongside a warning that the capital\u2019s roads will be \u201ccongested\u201d.\n TfL said \u201csevere disruption\u201d on the Tube was expected on both strike days, with a \u201chigh chance\u201d of no Underground services.\n However, there was slightly better news for commuters travelling into work on Wednesday and Friday.\n Despite early concerns about both mornings being chaotic, TfL said that service frequencies should improve after 9am and advised passengers to delay their journeys \u2013 while considering whether they were \u201cessential\u201d and could be made on another day.\n The talks on Monday between the RMT and TfL were held away from the conciliation service Acas, where they have twice met over the last fortnight without a breakthrough.\n TfL was hopeful of a \u201cpositive outcome for London\u201d.\n But when the talks quickly failed to achieve a breakthrough, the RMT increased the pressure on Mr Khan to support TfL staff who he had previously described as performing \u201cheroically\u201d through the pandemic by keeping services running.\n In a statement on Monday afternoon, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \u201cSadiq Khan knows that this raid on our members\u2019 pensions and conditions is unfair and would lead to industrial action because he\u2019s said it himself. \n \u201cYet only last week we find out that the mayor has agreed to submit proposals to the Government that will result in attacks on those pensions.\n \"Which side is the mayor on? For the good of his workers and London\u2019s economic recovery, Sadiq Khan needs to stand firm against the government, stop the pensions raid and end the job massacre.\u201d\n TfL\u2019s advice to Londoners to work from home is thought to be unprecedented, even though a full bus service will operate alongside the mainline railway.\n Andy Lord, TfL\u2019s chief operating officer, said: \u201cI would ask anyone who needs to use the Tube on March 1 and 3 to check before they make their journey, consider whether they are able to work from home and use alternative modes of transport where possible.\n \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely there will be an Underground service running during the strike action and services are likely to be affected on the mornings of March 2 and 4 too. I apologise to customers for this and understand they will be frustrated by this strike action, but urge them not to take it out on those who are trying to help.\n \u201cWe haven\u2019t proposed any changes to pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody has or will lose their jobs because of the proposals we have set out, so this action is completely unnecessary.\n \u201cWe know our customers deserve better than this, which is why we\u2019re urging the RMT to talk to us so we can find a resolution to this dispute and call off this action, which is threatening London\u2019s recovery from the pandemic.\u201d\n The strike follows TfL\u2019s plan to axe 500 to 600 station staff posts and the RMT\u2019s fear that staff pensions will be at risk.\n TfL insists no staff member will lose their job and the reduction in posts will be made from not filling existing vacancies and not replacing staff who leave or retire.\n But the RMT fears staff who remain will be forced to work more \u201cextreme hours\u201d shifts early in the morning or very late at night and will be more likely to have to work alone.\n Last Friday\u2019s \u00a3200m Government bailout deal requires TfL to act by June on any measures suggested in an independent report on its pension scheme, which is due to be published by March 31.\n The review of the \u201cgenerous\u201d TfL pension fund \u2013 which costs it about \u00a3375m a year in contributions \u2013 is a requirement of both last Friday\u2019s bailout and the bailout received in June 2021.\n TfL is required by the Government to become \u201cfinancially sustainable\u201d by April 2023 and find an additional \u00a3400m of cuts over and above about \u00a3500m already in the pipeline.\n TfL said on Monday that \u201cthe safety of staff and customers will always remain paramount and the changes will protect as many jobs as possible for the people who work for TfL today, allowing more flexibility to adapt to changing customer requirements\u201d.\n It said of the pension review, which is being conducted by former TUC chief Sir Brendan Barber: \u201cThis is simply a review and there are no plans for change. The review remains ongoing and no recommendations have yet been made.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

{"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 28 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-28 21:52:50"}, {"article_body": "A row has broken out over Sadiq Khan\u2019s record on Tube strikes as Londoncommuters face a week of travel chaos.\n The GLA Conservatives said that the number of days of strikes since Mr Khan became mayor in May 2016 would this week surpass the joint total under the previous 16 years of Ken Livingstone\u2019s and Boris Johnson\u2019s mayoralties.\n The London Underground is expected to be forced to close throughout Tuesday and Thursday due to the first network-wide action in more than five years. \n Passengers have also been warned to expect that services on Wednesday and Friday morning will be \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d due to the knock-on impact of the 24-hour walkouts by 10,000 RMT members, in a dispute over pensions and station staffing cuts. \n It comes as Tube and bus fares increase by an average of 4.8 per cent from Tuesday and national rail fares by an average of 3.8 per cent. \n On Monday, City Hall admitted disruption on the Tube was \u201cinevitable\u201d and said the Mayor was urging the RMT to return to the negotiating table. The strikes could lose Transport for London an estimated \u00a320m in fares income.\n Mr Khan\u2019s strike record came under criticism from his Tory rivals at City Hall, who said he would reach 52 days of industrial action in less than six years as a result of the Tuesday and Thursday walk-outs \u2013 compared with 16 days of disruption in Mr Livingstone\u2019s two terms and 35 when Mr Johnson was mayor between 2008 and 2016.\n However, Mr Khan\u2019s spokeswoman said there had been a \u201c70.2 per cent reduction\u201d in strike days compared with Mr Johnson, when the total number of staff shifts that were lost to strikes were counted rather than simply the days on which strikes took place.\n The GLA Conservatives say that if all the proposed strikes go ahead, the number of days when there is some form of action on the Tube will reach 87 by the end of June.\n Many strikes only affect one or two Tube lines or are localised disputes at only one or a handful of stations. Network-wide closures, including those involving more than one Tube union, have become rare.\n Keith Prince, transport spokesman for the GLA Conservatives, told the Standard: \u201cIf the Mayor claims that he has a good strike record he\u2019s delusional. He has the worst record of any London mayor and almost as many incidents of strike action than the two previous mayors combined. I think it\u2019s time he admitted to himself that he\u2019s failing London.\n \u201cThis is a catastrophic week for London\u2019s commuters, the network will take time to reset after each strike and will then have to reckon with further strikes on Friday and Saturday evening.\u201d\n The latest Government bailout secured by TfL London last Friday \u2013 a deal that is worth \u00a3200m \u2013 is likely to heighten union concerns about the threat to staff pensions.\n The deal reaffirms the Government\u2019s wish for TfL to begin making changes by the end of June to cut the \u00a3375m annual cost of its pension scheme. \n The Government has made the review of the TfL pension scheme a condition of both last Friday\u2019s bailout and the one received by TfL last June. It also insists on further cost-savings at TfL.\n The Tube was hit by eight days of RMT strikes last November and December, including two daytime strikes on five lines, in protest at the rotas used to staff the partial reopening of the Night Tube.\n The RMT resumed its action on the Night Tube on January 7 and says it will continue overnight every weekend until June \u2013 meaning a further 46 days when the Night Tube services on the Victoria and Central lines are disrupted.\n City Hall said that 32,212 staff shifts were lost to strikes when Mr Johnson was mayor \u2013 an average of 335.6 a month.\n In comparison, 7,010 have been lost in the 70 months of Mr Khan\u2019s mayoralty to date \u2013 an average of 97.7 per month, 70.2 per cent fewer than his predecessor.\n A spokeswoman for Mr Khan said: \u201cThe upcoming strike action will cause disruption to Londoners and businesses that are trying to recover from two devastating years. It will also damage TfL\u2019s revenues at a time when TfL is already under huge financial strain due to the pandemic.\n \u201cTfL are working to mitigate the impact of the strikes but disruption is inevitable. The mayor urges Londoners who need to travel on March 1 and 3 to check before they make their journey, consider whether they are able to work from home and use alternative modes of transport where possible. \n \u201cSadiq doesn\u2019t want to see strike action and is imploring the unions to come to the table and work with City Hall and TfL.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

Government"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 26 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-26 09:02:21"}, {"article_body": "A breakthrough in the funding of Transport for London was announced on Friday when it agreed a new Covid bailout deal with the Government.\n The latest deal gives TfL an additional \u00a3200m and will run until June 24.\n The new deal \u201calso includes the potential for a longer-term capital investment settlement for TfL\u201d, the Department for Transport announced.\n But it could lead to more Tube strikes as Mayor Sadiq Khan remains under Government orders to reduce the costs of TfL\u2019s staff pension scheme.\n Mr Khan said : \u201cWhile I welcome and am relieved about this funding, once again the Government has just provided a short-term funding deal that will only enable TfL to continue running transport services for a few more months.\n \u201cThis agreement makes reference to future capital investment for TfL, but it\u2019s essential that this quickly turns into a concrete commitment from the Government. \n \u201cThe only way we will be able to avoid significant and damaging cuts to tube and bus services is if the Government steps up and provides the longer term capital funding TfL urgently needs.\u201d \n It is the fourth Government bail-out for TfL and takes the total amount of help to almost \u00a35bn \u2013 money that has effectively replaced income lost by TfL as a result of the collapse in travel during the pandemic.\n The DfT said the aim was to finalise a deal on TfL\u2019s capital funding \u2013 money for long-term investment projects such as new Tube trains, signalling systems, new buses and road and bridge upgrades \u2013 before the current financial year ends at the end of March.\n However this \u201cwill be dependent on the Mayor and TfL\u2019s cooperation with the Government\u201d, including providing sufficient information regarding its capital investment plans and meeting conditions set out in last June\u2019s settlement.\n Mr Khan had already outlined plans to generate around \u00a3500m a year by introducing a \u00a32 a day \u201cclean air charge\u201d by May 2024 or expanding the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) from the suburbs to the Greater London boundary - or potentially doing both.\n He would them follow this by scrapping the Ulez and congestion charge and replacing them with a London-wide system of road user charging by the end of the decade.\n A Greater London boundary charge, costing out-of-town motorists from \u00a33.50-a-day to drive into the capital, also remains on the table - though is opposed by the Government - while an extra \u00a320 a year is being levied on council tax bills for the next three years.\n The DfT said the \u00a3200m was on top of a pledge in last October\u2019s Spending Review to provide over a billion pounds of capital investment every year.\n Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:\u00a0\u201cOver the past two years, the Government has repeatedly shown its commitment to London and the transport network it depends upon, by providing close to \u00a35bn in emergency funding.\n \u201cThese support packages must be fair to all taxpayers and the settlement agreed today provides enough to cover lost revenue from the pandemic while the mayor follows through on his promises to keep TfL on the path to financial sustainability by 2023.\u201d\n TfL commissioner Andy Byford said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for the extra funding and pleased that a deal had finally been struck.\n He said: \u201cThe mayor has already set out a range of proposals that will help support TfL\u2019s financial sustainability in the future but it is essential\u00a0that agreement is reached with Government on longer term\u00a0capital support\u00a0during this funding period.\n \u201cThis is crucial for the coming years if a period of the \u2018managed decline\u2019 of London\u2019s transport network is to be avoided.\n \u201cWe will be meeting regularly to work towards agreement on the Government funding of the capital investment priorities shared by them, us and the mayor. \n \u201cThe Government has confirmed in this agreement that they support the operation and maintenance of essential and safe transport services in London, enabling us to continue our full and vital contribution to economic recovery and to support the Government\u2019s priorities on decarbonisation, air quality and making transport better for users.\u201d\n Caroline Pidgeon, chair of the London Assembly transport committee, said: \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s extension \u2013 but these continued delays to a long-term solution are not useful, and Transport for London is not a political football.\u00a0 For the sake of TfL\u2019s capital and revenue, a permanent deal needs to be in place.\u201d\n Under the latest deal, Mr Khan will put his options for raising extra cash out to consultation before the end of June. \n He will also outline options to save \u201cup to \u00a3400m\u201d in the 2022/23 financial year \u2013 which appears to be less than the \u00a3730m TfL feared it would have to cut by 2024/25.\n Mr Khan is also required to make \u201csignificant progress\u201d in moving TfL\u2019s pension funding into a \u201cfinancially sustainable position\u201d \u2013 which could mean more Tube strikes.\n The RMT union has already confirmed two 24-hour walkouts next week, on March 1 and 3, in part because of the perceived threat to staff pensions, and more action could now follow.\n Prior to Friday\u2019s announcement, TfL\u2019s most recent deal had been first agreed in June last year. \n This was due to run out on December 11, but was extended to February 4, then February 18 and then to today, February 25 - allowing TfL a week to decide whether to accept its terms.\n Earlier this month Mr Byford revealed he had rejected a draft deal because it contained \u201cunacceptable\u201d conditions thought to relate to extra cuts that TfL would have to make in return for the cash. \n TfL was seeking more than \u00a31\u2009billion until April next year to keep Tube and bus services running \u2014 by which time it is required to break even on a day-to-day basis \u2014 plus a longer-term capital funding.\n The June deal required Mr Khan to increase Tube and bus fares by 4.8 per cent \u2013 with the new prices being introduced next Tuesday.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

"Transport for London must work towards introducing driverless trains on the Tube under the terms of its new \u00a3200m bail-out deal, it can be revealed.\n Full details of the conditions that TfL is required to meet in return for its latest bailout were published in a 15-page letter from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on Friday afternoon. \n TfL is also to review passenger demand on its Tube, bus and Overground network in April to determine whether service levels should be maintained or reduced.\n Driverless trains have been mentioned in previous deals but the latest settlement, which runs until June 24, makes clear the Government\u2019s wish for research into their feasibility to remain a priority.\n Tube bosses are willing to co-operate with the work but believe introducing driverless

\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A memorandum is to be drawn up on the \u201cpermanent\u201d reopening of Hammersmith bridge \u2013 including to motorists if budgets allow.\n \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Government will not pay more than a third of the cost of reopening Hammersmith bridge.\n

\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bailout cash cannot be used to pay TfL bonuses and individual bonuses to executives are discouraged.\n \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wages for Tube staff \u2013 which are expected to rise by more than eight per cent \u2013 most be brought closer to the national average in

after being extended on three occasions since the start of December as TfL and the Department for Transport negotiated over its terms.\n In his letter to Mayor Sadiq Khan, Mr Shapps said in relation to driverless trains: \u201cTfL\u2019s record of modernisation and innovation should not leave it behind other European networks, which are achieving significant operational efficiencies through driverless trains.\n \u201cAccordingly, DfT will lead a joint programme with TfL on the implementation of driverless trains on the London Underground, recognising TfL\u2019s safety, regulatory and statutory responsibilities.\n \u201cThe network review should provide an evidence-based recommendation on how best to progress with driverless trains. TfL should continue working with DfT to make progress developing and testing innovative technology, where it can save money in the delivery of driverless trains.\u201d\n On the TfL pension fund, Mr Shapps confirmed the requirement from last June\u2019s bailout that it move into a \u201cfinancially sustainable position\u201d.\n At present, TfL pays more than six times the contribution that employees make, at a cost to it of \u00a3401m in 2021.\n A report on reforming the scheme is due from Sir Brendan Barber by March 31. TfL will have until June 24 to \u201cconsider and progress, as appropriate, any proposals that may be recommended by the final report in order to move the Fund into a financially sustainable position\u201d, Mr Shapps said.\n Mr Shapps said that the DfT, TfL and Hammersmith and Fulham council, which owns Hammersmith Bridge, would jointly commit \u201cto the reopening of Hammersmith Bridge on a permanent basis \u2013 initially to pedestrians, cyclists and river traffic and, depending on cost, to motorists.\u201d\n On healthy streets, after fears that TfL would have to axe \u00a3483m from safety schemes, Mr Shapps wrote: \u201cWe expect TfL to continue to deliver ambitious healthy streets and active travel programmes including funding for the London boroughs under the local implementation plan process and will set aside \u00a350m for this within the fourth funding period.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/26/10/4f2b03bc59a643f766bf5fb556c774a5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4Mzc1Njc2-2.34275721.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Surge hiring: Uber seeks 20,000 drivers as TfL grants new licence"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/04/14/497aca9d076308f208e5302db1bb985dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ2NDg4OTc3-2.64802743.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "The Leader podcast: London\u2019s Covid-19 spike and TfL\u2019s travel risk u-turn"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/22/09/d7d52ba24f5f18b2b616d59497769bfaY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4MDI1OTY4-2.53188618.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Outer London needs levelling up"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/02/13/Screenshot%202022-03-02%20at%2012.06.10.png?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Can remote prostate cancer monitoring improve men\u2019s quality of life?"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/when-tfl-price-fare-increase-2022-sadiq-khan-tube-bus-why-b982471.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Tfl price increase 2022: When will fares rise on London Tube and bus and why?"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 24 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-24 15:19:20"}, {"article_body": "Bus passengers will bear the brunt of the fares rise announced by Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n A single bus fare will increase by 10p to \u00a31.65 \u2013 an increase of almost 6.5 per cent.\n By the time season tickets and Travelcards are taken into account, Transport for London expects its bus revenue to increase on last year by 5.9 per cent \u2013 compared with an average rise of 4.4 per cent on the Tube.\n Overall, the fares rises are expected to generate an additional \u00a3151m for TfL by the end of December 2022.\n When will the fares increase?\n The new fares will come into effect on Tuesday March 1 \u2013 just over a fortnight away. The average increase will be 4.8 per cent \u2013 the biggest annual rise in a decade.\n Fares normally rise annually on the first working day of the New Year. Because of the pandemic, this is the second successive year that the rise has been delayed until March, primarily to tie in with the increase in national rail fares, itself delayed until next month.\n Why are bus fares increasing so much?\n Mr Khan has chosen to increase fares by 10p rather than repeat last year\u2019s rise of 5p. Prior to last year, the cost of a single bus fare had not risen since 2014.\n Because cash is no longer accepted on buses, the Mayor could theoretically have chosen to increase fares by 7p or 8p but it has always been tradition to use round numbers where possible.\n But Mr Khan, as promised, has retained the Hopper ticket - which allows passengers to make multiple bus journeys within 60 minutes without having to pay again.\n The fares have to rise by at least 3.8 per cent, under Government instructions that TfL mirrors the rise in national rail fares, also due to be implemented next month. \n Mr Khan chose an overall 4.8 per cent hike to generate an extra \u00a3151m for TfL by the end of 2022, to ease the financial crisis it has suffered as a consequence of the pandemic, which sent its fares income plummeting.\n How much more will it cost on the Tube?\n It depends on how many zones you travel across. A single journey in zone 1 using an Oyster card or Contactless card or phone will cost an extra 10p, taking it to \u00a32.50.\n For many Londoners, the key figure will be the daily \u201ccap\u201d \u2013 the maximum amount paid for a number of journeys, for example to and from work and trips at lunchtime or after work. The cap increases by an average of 3.8 per cent.\n The zones 1-2 daily cap increases by 30p a day to \u00a37.70. The zones 1-3 cap rises by the same amount to \u00a39. Zones 1-4 jumps 40p to \u00a311. Zones 1-6 goes up 60p to \u00a314.10.\n How many people will be affected?\n Many more Londoners will be affected by the bus fares rise than the Tube rise. Buses are regarded as the \u201cworkhorse\u201d of the capital\u2019s public transport network and have always carried more passengers than the Tube.\n Pre-pandemic, there would be more than six million weekday bus journeys a day, compared with about four million on the Underground.\n Last week TfL said that on February 3 there were 4.6m bus journeys, 74 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, compared with 2.43m Tube journeys, 59 per cent of normal.\n Why is this politically difficult for Sadiq Khan?\n As the son of a bus driver \u2013 a fact he never tires of repeating \u2013 Mr Khan is well aware that poorer Londoners depend on the bus.\n Many low-paid workers either cannot afford the higher prices of the Tube or live in areas not served by the Underground \u2013 or both.\n Mr Khan\u2019s late father used to drive the 44 bus and his natural support comes from traditional Labour voters.\n But the bus network is heavily subsidised \u2013 while the Tube makes a \u201cprofit\u201d \u2013 and Mr Khan knows that he needs to increase revenue from bus fares, both for the wider benefit of TfL and also to protect bus routes themselves.\n Since November, 25 routes have been unable to be re-tendered due to TfL\u2019s financial crisis, meaning that new vehicles \u2013 like the electric 63 bus unveiled last week \u2013 cannot be introduced and there is a risk that entire routes could disappear.\n Under the \u201cmanaged decline\u201d scenario, Mr Khan has said that 100 of the 700 bus routes may have to be axed and another 100 see frequencies reduced. Last week one of Mr Khan\u2019s allies, Hackney mayor Phil Glanville, went public with a bid to save the 21 bus.\n Are there any other increases?\n Yes, the Emirates cable car will increase from \u00a34 to \u00a35 for a single trip across the Thames (for Oyster or Contactless payments) and from \u00a35 to \u00a36 for cash. \n The cable car is largely a tourist attraction but is one way to reach the new City Hall at the Royal Docks, which is otherwise poorly connected, at least until the Crossrail station at Custom House opens.\n TfL has not announced whether the cost of hiring a Boris bike, or the annual \u00a390 membership, will increase.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/12/09_Jan_JS_London_54.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "24-hour Tube strikes cost TfL \u00a313 million in lost fares"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/13/2de9f0e2aa020d7b20046197d3a34e84Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4NTUyNjYx-2.65645264.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "New Met Police Commissioner to be appointed in the summer"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/11/13/0a3849c7ecdfc6ed66b123eccb515e86Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ0NjcxNTY2-2.55734824.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Patel orders review into way Khan ousted Dame Cressida as Met boss"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/01/28/12/Turkaegean_Orange_11648x8736px.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Why the Turkish Aegean needs to be on your holiday radar"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/14/14/newFile-4.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=2016%3A1343%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Fares on the Emirates cable car are being increased, despite it being a way to reach the new City Hall</p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/transport/silvertown-tunnel-protests-city-hall-greenwich-sadiq-khan-east-london-b984360.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Protests across London as Sadiq Khan presses ahead with Silvertown Tunnel"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 24 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-24 13:45:08"}, {"article_body": "More than 100 GPs, hospital doctors and health workers on Thursday accused Sadiq Khan of planning an \u201cassault on the health of east Londoners\u201d by pressing ahead with the Silvertown tunnel.\n A protest was taking place on Thursday morning outside the new City Hall \u2013 only yards from where the northern entrance to the \u00a32.2bn \u201cinner city motorway\u201d is being constructed.\n A letter signed by 125 current and retired health professionals was being submitted to the mayor as he appeared before the London Assembly to present his annual budget.\n Campaigners are holding a week of action against the tunnel, which would link north Greenwich and Newham. This will continue on Thursday night with a protest at Greenwich council and will culminate with a rally outside City Hall on Saturday.\n Mr Khan believes building the tunnel will ease congestion and pollution from vehicles queueing to use the Blackwall tunnel.\n In the letter, the medics say they \u201care at a loss to understand\u201d how building the Silvertown tunnel fits in with the Mayor\u2019s policy of reducing car use by 27 per cent by 2030.\n They wrote: \u201cWe all view the proposal to build this tunnel as an assault on the health of East Londoners and on the climate.\n \u201cWe urge you to put a stop to it, to invest the money in projects that will benefit people\u2019s health and reap the rewards of savings to the NHS that such beneficial policies would bring.\n \u201cWe are sure that you will want to leave a positive legacy as London Mayor and not be remembered as the one responsible for the Silvertown Tunnel with all of the inevitable pollution and greenhouse gases which will blight the health and wellbeing of those who live nearby.\u201d\n It is estimated that 20,000 and 30,000 more cars, vans and trucks a day will drive past will drive past homes and schools when the tunnel opens.\n Newham is the most polluted borough in the country with Tower Hamlets not far behind.\n Dr Jackie Applebee, chair of the Tower Hamlets local medical committee, told the Standard: \u201cIt will temporarily ease the congestion around the Blackwall tunnel area, but all the evidence shows that eventually opening new roads just increases traffic flow.\n \u201cThis will happen in Newham \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs and one with some of the worst air pollution in the country.\u201d\n Mr Khan says the fact that the Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels will be tolled will reduce traffic. But campaigners point to two legal opinions showing that the tolls could be overturned by future mayors.\n City Hall says that a TfL analysis of polluted locations found that, where a \u201cperceptible change\u201d was expected to result from the opening of the tunnel, none were at schools. \n It said there would be a dedicated bus lane in the tunnels, with up to 37 buses an hour in each direction.\n Seb Dance, Mr Khan\u2019s deputy mayor for transport, who met campaigners last week, said: \u201cThe Silvertown Tunnel will transform the way people can travel in a part of London that currently has few options for getting across the river. \n \u201cIn addition to providing new zero-emission cross-river bus services for an area in need of them, the tunnel will massively reduce the chronic congestion problems currently associated with the inadequate, Victorian-era Blackwall Tunnel. \n \u201cBoth tunnels will be tolled and, when combined with our overall policy of reducing car use across Greater London in favour of active and public transport options, the Silvertown tunnel will help reduce congestion and poor air quality around the Blackwall Tunnel area without increasing the volume of traffic crossing the river.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/04/18/acb646109d8e432b26508717f1965bb6Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ5MTcxNzYz-2.66209549.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Met to \u2018root out\u2019 officers\u2019 bad behaviour in tackling violence against women"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/10/AFP_32779PE.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick to leave post next week"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/11/23/10/MS%20Marble%20Arch.JPG?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Sadiq Khan criticised for refusing to block demolition of Marble Arch M&S"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/02/13/Screenshot%202022-03-02%20at%2012.06.10.png?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Can remote prostate cancer monitoring improve men\u2019s quality of life?"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/london-congestion-charge-changes-today-hours-pre-covid-pandemic-b983621.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "London congestion charge returns to pre-pandemic weekday hours"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall Joe Talora 23 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-23 18:14:39"}, {"article_body": "Motorists will be able to drive into central London after 6pm from Monday without having to pay the congestion charge.\n Mayor Sadiq Khan has decided to return the charge to its pre-pandemic weekday hours of 7am-6pm, having extended it until 10pm as a temporary measure in June 2020 to encourage walking and cycling and discourage car travel.\n But the charge will remain at \u00a315, rather than returning to \u00a311.50, and will also be enforced from midday to 6pm at weekends.\n Mr Khan has admitted that an increase in traffic after 6pm is \u201cto some extent, to be expected, as traffic is no longer disincentivised from driving in the congestion charge zone\u201d.\n He told the Standard that the C-charge\u2019s extended hours had been a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d and a short-term measure.\n Mr Khan said: \u201cWhat it was leading to was damage to the night-time economy, leading to jobs being lost, but also leading to our recovery not being as fast as it could have been.\n \u201cIt\u2019s really important for our policies to be pro-environment, pro-cleaning up our air and also pro-businesses.\n \u201cThese are businesses, by the way, that pay their taxes that lead to us having some of the brilliant policies that we have, from more cycle lanes to widening the pavements, to investing in public transport.\n \u201cIf businesses go bust, if fewer people are working in our city, if there is more unemployment, it\u2019s more difficult for us to provide the public transport system we want, but also it damages our economy.\u201d\n The changes are expected to generate an additional \u00a360m to \u00a380m a year for Transport for London when compared with pre-pandemic income.\n However, shortening the zone\u2019s operating hours from 10pm to 6pm will lose TfL about \u00a360m to \u00a370m a year in levies and penalty fines.\n Campaigners have previously warned that the C-charge may have to be re-imposed after 6pm if traffic increases dramatically.\n Motorists face a sting in the tail \u2013 Westminster council is planning to increase its on-street parking charges to generate an additional \u00a31,150,000 a year.\n The Tory-run council generated almost \u00a370m a year pre-pandemic from parking. It currently charges \u00a35.10 an hour to park in Soho, Covent Garden, Marylebone and Fitzrovia. This will increase to \u00a35.28 an hour.\n The council is planning \u201can increase of pay-to-park charges across all zones to maintain the differential with increasing public transport costs,\u201d council documents state.\n The change is also to allow parking wardens to be paid the London living wage of \u00a311.05 an hour.\n The council is also planning to increase the number of cameras used to capture driving offences. Westminster supported the 6pm cut-off but not the retention of the temporary C-charge at weekends.\n James Spencer, Westminster\u2019s cabinet member for city management, said: \u201cIn 2018 we announced that Westminster City Council was to become a London Living Wage employer and requested that our contractors follow suit.\n \u201cThe proposed increase \u2013 which will see the standard pay-to-park charges going up by 3.5 per cent - will go towards the cost of running the service. Our charges remain in line with, or lower than, neighbouring boroughs.\n \u201cAdded to this, the increases follow the recent rise in public transport fares, maintaining a differential between parking in Westminster and public transport.\u201d\n TfL predicts that retaining the \u00a315 C-charge should result in a four per cent reduction in car mileage in the zone during the week and 15 per cent at weekends, when compared with pre-pandemic levels, and encourage journeys to be walked, cycles or made by public transport.\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

mask on the Tube and bus is to be formally ditched \u2013 but Londoners will be \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d to continue covering up as a courtesy to fellow passengers.\n Transport for London on Wednesday confirmed that, from Thursday, it would no longer be a \u201ccondition of carriage\u201d that face masks be worn on its services, to tie in with wider lifting of restrictions as part of Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cliving with covid\u201d plan.\n But TfL will \u201cstrongly recommend\u201d that mask wearing continues \u2013 in line with advice being given to passengers using national rail services.\n TfL decided to drop its condition of carriage on face coverings after considering data showing that Covid infection rates have fallen consistently since the start of the year.\n The latest rates are due to be published on Wednesday afternoon but London last week had the highest infection rates in England, with 5.3 per cent of the city\u2019s population likely to test positive for Covid in the week to February 12, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n However, more than 98 per cent of adults in England have Covid antibodies that will help protect them against serious illness, the ONS said.\n Lilli Matson, TfL\u2019s chief safety, health and environment officer, said: \u201cWe have seen increasing numbers of customers return to our network as they begin to return to offices and workplaces, as well as to bars, theatres, restaurants and other cultural venues. \n \u201cFollowing the Government\u2019s decision to lift coronavirus restrictions and the falling infection rates in London, we will be removing the condition of carriage that requires customers to wear face coverings from February 24, but will continue to strongly recommend that customers and staff wear them as they are proven to reduce the risk of transmission and we know they provide confidence to people using public transport.\u201d \n Mayor Sadiq Khan regards face masks as a \u201csimple, effective measure that give Londoners confidence to travel\u201d.\n He said: \u201cI urge passengers to be considerate of their fellow Londoners and continue to wear a face covering where appropriate unless exempt.\u201d\n TfL also strongly encourages the continued use of face coverings in taxis and private hire vehicles by both drivers and passengers. \n The number of passengers using the Tube last week was about 60 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, with between 2.2m and 2.5m journeys a day, though numbers will have been suppressed by the school half-term holidays.\n There were about 4.5m bus journeys a day last week \u2013 75 per cent of normal.\n The legal requirement to wear a mask on public transport had been axed by the Government when its \u201cPlan B\u201d rules were lifted on January 27.\n Since then, TfL staff and British Transport Police have had no power to issue \u00a3200 fines for non-compliance and the number of passengers wearing masks has fallen to about 50 per cent.\n Face masks were mandatory in the first year of the pandemic but were first ditched nationally by the Government last July \u2013 only to be reintroduced from November 30 as omicron ripped through the country.\n Between the end of November and January 6, TfL enforcement officers stopped more than 43,000 passengers who were not wearing a mask.\n Of these, 2,195 were prevented from travelling, 906 people were thrown off a bus or Tube and 1,575 received a fixed penalty notice.\n On Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he would continue to wear a face mask on the Tube.\n \u201cFor now, although the infection levels have been falling significantly, week after week, I think where infection levels are at the moment, if I was on the London Tube, for example, and it was packed, I would wear a face mask,\u201d he said.\n TfL regarded mask-wearing as a vital part of keeping its workforce safe. A total of 105 TfL staff and contractors have died with Covid since the start of the pandemic.\n Experts said it was important not to behave as if the pandemic had ended and called for a gradual lifting of restrictions.\n Dr Jyotsna Vohra, director of policy at the Royal Society for Public Health, said: \u201cTo completely drop indoor mask wearing especially in crowded settings \u2013 a cheap and simple measure \u2013 is a missed opportunity to demonstrate consideration and inclusivity towards vulnerable groups.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src":

As many as 100 routes could be at risk.\n More than 40 bus routes had their services reduced during 2021, and TfL has already laid out plans to make major changes to several key routes in the next month or so.\n Here is everything you need to know about proposed changes to major bus routes:\n 271\n Over the festive period, TfL opened a public consultation on its plans to make major changes to London\u2019s bus network.\n One of the most significant changes proposed was a plan to completely axe the 271 bus route that runs from Highgate Village to Moorgate.\n TfL has said it must \u201ccontinuously review the bus network to ensure services reflect changing demand and deliver value for money\u201d and has suggested that the capacity of the 271 route currently exceeds demand.\n In outlining the case for the proposals, TfL said the cuts would \u201chelp to make the bus network simpler, more efficient and well connected, as well as ensuring resources are better invested and aligned to passenger demand\u201d.\n Crucially though, TfL has said the cuts would \u201chelp reduce operating costs\u201d as it looks to plug a nearly \u00a31.5 billion funding black hole.\n While the 271 route would be axed under TfL\u2019s plans, the N271 night bus would be retained and extended from Highgate Village to North Finchley.\n 21\n With the 271 route set to be axed, TfL has proposed altering the route of the 21 bus service to partially replace it.\n Instead of running from Newington Green as it currently does, the planned changes would see the 21 run from Holloway Nag\u2019s Head towards Hoxton along the previous 271 route before continuing down to Lewisham along the existing route.\n Though TfL has said these changes would \u201chelp to simplify the bus network\u201d and \u201cprovide a frequency of service that better matches passenger numbers\u201d, the plan has been met with backlash by locals.\n Mayor of Hackney Philip Glanville has said the existing services are a \u201cvital\u201d part of Hackney\u2019s public transport network, and that he is backing a local campaign to save the route.\n A petition on Change.org calling for TfL to save the 271 and 21 bus routes has received more than 700 signatures at the time of writing.\n While 1,511 people responded to TfL\u2019s public consultation, local campaigner Julie Hamwood told the Hackney Gazette that many people were \u201csurprised\u201d that it took place over Christmas and that \u201cnobody knew this was happening\u201d.\n Campaigners have warned that removing the 21 service will lead to overcrowding on other services such as the 141 and will make it harder for people to commute or get to school.\n TfL has proposed a new 620 school route that would replace the current school day only 143 buses between Archway Station and Bishop Douglass School.\n 1 and 168\n Alongside the public consultation to make changes to bus services in Hackney and Islington, TfL also ran a public consultation over Christmas on changes to routes between Southwark and central London.\n The primary change put forward by TfL is a plan to axe the iconic 1 route between Tottenham Court Road and Canada Water, as well as the 168 between Hampstead Heath and Old Kent Road.\n The two services would be replaced by one single route, provisionally numbered 1, which would run from Hampstead Heath to Canada Water.\n TfL has said this new service, which would be given a new number following a review, would operate at a frequency of one bus every eight minutes during the day on Monday to Saturday and every 10 to 12 minutes during evenings and on Sundays.\n The existing N1 night service from Tottenham Court Road and Thamesmead would continue under the new plans.\n 188\n The other major change outlined in the second public consultation was a plan to cut back the 188 route from Russel Square and have it instead start at Tottenham Court Road, with the rest of the route to remain the same.\n TfL has said there are a \u201chigh number of services\u201d running on the 1, 168 and 188 but there are \u201ctoo many buses for the passenger numbers\u201d which have decreased since the start of the pandemic. TfL expects that reduced demand will continue to be the trend beyond the pandemic.\n Both consultations ended on January 9 and TfL has said it intends to make a final decision on whether to go ahead with the proposals in early March.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/26/10/4f2b03bc59a643f766bf5fb556c774a5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4Mzc1Njc2-2.34275721.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Surge hiring: Uber seeks 20,000 drivers as TfL grants new licence"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/04/14/497aca9d076308f208e5302db1bb985dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ2NDg4OTc3-2.64802743.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "The Leader podcast: London\u2019s Covid-19 spike and TfL\u2019s travel risk u-turn"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/22/09/d7d52ba24f5f18b2b616d59497769bfaY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4MDI1OTY4-2.53188618.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Outer London needs levelling up"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/08/14/Rugby-Podcast-1500x1000.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Lawrence Dallaglio\u2019s Rugby Podcast"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/15/11/TfL%20current%2021%2C%20271%20map.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=1754%3A1241%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>The current route of the 21 and 271 bus services</p>"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/15/11/TfL%20proposed%2021%20map.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=1754%3A1241%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Proposed new route of the 21 service</p>"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/15/11/TfL%20proposed%201%2C%20188%20map.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=1754%3A1241%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Proposed route of the new service that will replace the 1 and 168</p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/politics/sajid-javid-wear-face-masks-tfl-london-tube-underground-b983826.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "\u2018I\u2019ll still wear a face mask on packed Tube\u2019, says Sajid Javid"}, {"author_container": "By    Rachael Burford Political Reporter @RachaelBurford 22 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-22 09:12:11"}, {"article_body": "Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said he will continue to wear a mask on a packed Tube train because the number of Covid infections in London is still high.\n The legal requirement to wear face coverings in public settings was scrapped by the Government earlier this year, but TfL insisted travellers still wear masks as a condition of carriage. \n All coronavirus restrictions are due to end in England on Thursday and free mass testing will stop from April 1. \n But Mr Javid said he would continue to wear a mask on busy Tube trains in London. \n He told LBC: \u201cFor now, although the infection levels have been falling significantly week after week, I think where infection levels are at the moment if I was on the London tube for example and it was packed, I would wear a face mask.\u201d\n The capital has seen around 5,000 new infections a day in the last week, roughly half the number at this time in January.\n City Hall has confirmed that compulsory mask wearing will be scrapped on its transport network after the government ends all remaining Covid restrictions - including the duty to isolate for those who test positive - under its \"living with Covid\" plan. \n When asked how people would know when it was safe not to wear masks on public transport, Mr Javid said authorities would set out guidance but commuters would have to take \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d. \n He added: \u201cI would look at what\u2019s the general prevalence of where case numbers are, where infection numbers are, what hospitalisation number we have.

An independent review into TfL\u2019s pensions is also set to take place, with unions threatening further industrial action if any changes are made without consultation.\n In addition to this, TfL has axed a number of capital investment projects such as the Bakerloo Line extension and the electrification of London\u2019s bus fleet.\n A TfL spokesperson has said that \u201cwe continue to discuss our funding requirements with the Government\u201d and that \u201cit is essential London receives the sustained long-term Government funding that is vital for the coming years\u201d.\n The spokesperson said: \u201cWe have agreed with the Government that our existing funding agreement will be extended until 25 February so that these discussions can be concluded.

It has already received more than \u00a34.5bn from the Department for Transport to compensate it for lost fares income.\n The impact on TfL of repeatedly having to fight for Government support due to its pandemic losses \u2013 there have been four rounds of negotiations - was made clear on Friday.\n Mr Khan revealed that 10 staff work full-time on securing deals and meeting the conditions of funding, while TfL commissioner Andy Byford and chief finance officer Simon Kilonback focus half their time on the bailouts.\n In addition, between 200 and 250 TfL staff have spent 25-30 per cent of their time over the last two years preparing for the negotiations and meeting their terms.\n Mr Khan, in a written answer to Lib-Dem London Assembly member Caroline Pidgeon, said: \u201cThis additional work has resulted in a number of employees working excessive hours at times to absorb the additional workloads.\u201d\n Ms Pidgeon said: \u201cWe have the wasteful reality of too many TfL staff being constantly tied up in never ending negotiations and form filling for the Department for Transport.\n \u201cNo business could successfully operate with its senior staff not being able to look ahead and make long term decisions, yet this is exactly the situation TfL has been put in.\u201d\n The Department for Transport has been approached for comment.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/09/20/08/1341399433.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Thunderground: noisy Northern line sparks most Tube complaints"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/03/18/2.65643111.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Minimum Oyster card auto top-up cut to \u00a310 amid cost of living crisis"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/26/10/4f2b03bc59a643f766bf5fb556c774a5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4Mzc1Njc2-2.34275721.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Surge hiring: Uber seeks 20,000 drivers as TfL grants new licence"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/08/12/Secret_Cinema_-_Bridgerton_-_16th_February_2022_by_Luke_Dyson_-_LD2_0032.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Bridgerton fans: don\u2019t miss this immersive Secret Cinema experience"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/london-tube-underground-bus-public-transport-fare-ticket-increase-b982405.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Sadiq Khan announces biggest London Tube and bus fare hike in a decade"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 17 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-17 16:41:16"}, {"article_body": "Tube and bus fares will rise by an average of almost five per cent in a fortnight, Sadiq Khan announced on Monday.\n The hike, which is below the current 5.4 per cent rate of CPI inflation, is the biggest annual jump in Transport for London fares in a decade and will mean passengers paying an estimated \u00a3151m more to travel this year.\n Single Tube fares using Oyster or Contactless tickets will increase by 10p in zone one and between 10p to 30p across the rest of the Underground network.\n Bus fares will rise by 10p to \u00a31.65 \u2013 an increase of almost 6.5 per cent, meaning bus passengers, who are typically on lower incomes, will suffer a bigger proportionate rise than those using the Tube.\n The increases are on top of already announced changes, such as premium Heathrow Tube fares throughout the day and the ban on free travel for over 60s before 9am, that will generate a further \u00a360m to \u00a380m a year.\n Sadiq Khan announces biggest London Tube and bus fare hike in a decade\n The overall fares increase across all TfL services averages 4.8 per cent.

This held the price of pay-as-you-go fares constant between 2016 and 2020. It deprived TfL of \u00a3640m in income pre-pandemic but Mr Khan said it saved the average London family \u201cup to \u00a3200\u201d.\n City Hall said the restrictions on use of the Older Person\u2019s Freedom Pass and 60+ Pass \u201care being reviewed and may be subject to further changes later this year\u201d.\n TfL\u2019s current Government bailout has been twice extended and is due to run out on Friday, February 18.\n A hike of RPI inflation plus one per cent \u2013 which would have equated to 4.8 per cent \u2013 had been part of TfL\u2019s covid bailout agreed with the Government last June.\n But last month Transport Secretary Grant Shapps quietly dropped this condition \u2013 though he said any shortfall that resulted from a smaller increase would not be covered by the Government.\n TfL says it has already entered \u201cmanaged decline\u201d due to the lack of guarantees on long-term funding, with 25 bus contracts yet to be renegotiated.\n Its \u201chealthy streets\u201d budget, which is designed to encourage safe cycling and walking, faces a \u00a3473\u2009million cut, new signalling for the Piccadilly line has been axed and the Tube is at risk of \u201cmulti-day closures\u201d because of a lack of cash for repairs.\n Sian Berry, a Green member of the London Assembly and former mayoral candidate, said the bus fares hike felt like a return to the \u201cbad old days\u201d.\n Emma Gibson, chief executive of passenger watchdog London TravelWatch, said: \u201cLondoners affected by the current cost of living crisis will be disappointed to hear that bus fares are going up by almost 6.5 per cent in March, even more than the average rise across TfL services.\n \u201cMany key workers and those on low incomes rely solely on the bus, as they can\u2019t afford the Tube or train, and they will be hit hardest by this rise.\u201d\n Caroline Pidgeon, Lib-Dem chair of the London Assembly transport committee, said: \u201cThis announcement will be of little comfort for passengers who will now be facing even higher fares,\u00a0 especially many low income bus passengers.\n \u201cHowever, given the terrible financial position facing TfL and the straitjacket being imposed by central Government it is sadly inevitable.\u201d\n Keith Prince, Tory transport spokesman on the London Assembly, said: \u201cOnce again so-called socialist Sadiq Khan has chosen to punish those less able to pay. As with his Ulez, Khan\u2019s increases will hit the less well off.\u201d \n Loading....\n The Department for Transport said: \u201cWe have repeatedly shown our commitment to supporting London\u2019s transport network throughout the pandemic, providing over \u00a34.5bn in emergency funding to Transport for London and pledging a further billion pounds of capital investment every year up until at least 2024/25 - all at a time of significant pressure on the national finances.\n \u201cWe\u2019re aware that TfL are still feeling the aftereffects of the pandemic but it is the Mayor\u2019s responsibility to accelerate overdue reforms that will ensure TfL becomes financially sustainable.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/12/09_Jan_JS_London_54.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "24-hour Tube strikes cost TfL \u00a313 million in lost fares"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/13/2de9f0e2aa020d7b20046197d3a34e84Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4NTUyNjYx-2.65645264.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "New Met Police Commissioner to be appointed in the summer"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/11/13/0a3849c7ecdfc6ed66b123eccb515e86Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ0NjcxNTY2-2.55734824.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Patel orders review into way Khan ousted Dame Cressida as Met boss"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/23/14/GettyImages-1280506989.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "How Jobcentre Plus can put you in touch with the right people"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/uk/annual-season-ticket-costs-rise-london-commuters-rail-fares-b982922.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Season ticket cost to rise by over \u00a3200 for some London commuters"}, {"author_container": "By    David Bond Deputy Political Editor @djbond6873 17 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-17 06:08:43"}, {"article_body": "Annual season ticket costs are to rise by more than \u00a3200 for some London commuters, new research reveals.\n The 3.8 per cent hike in rail fares is the biggest rise in a decade and will come into force next month, just as bus and tube fares in the capital rise by nearly five per cent in March.\n With inflation set to soar further this year and energy bills and taxes set to rise, the increase in fares will add further pressure to already squeezed household budgets.\n The Government is also facing calls to freeze rail fares to encourage more workers to return to the office and help boost London\u2019s economic recovery following the pandemic.\n According to the analysis, carried out by the Liberal Democrats, the rise in season ticket costs will be felt right across London\u2019s commuter belt and on almost every rail operator.\n Passengers travelling into the capital from Canterbury will be hit with the biggest surge, with the cost of an annual season ticket on SouthEastern rising from \u00a35888 to \u00a36112 - a jump of \u00a3224.\n By contrast, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents Britain\u2019s railway companies, says the average price for an annual season ticket last year was just under \u00a33000.\n Commuters from Winchester will see a rise of \u00a3212 a year, taking their annual fare to \u00a35792, while passengers travelling to central London from Oxford will have to pay an extra \u00a3211, taking their annual fare to \u00a35755.\n Cambridge commuters will pay \u00a3202 more a year, Hastings \u00a3200, Lewes and Eastbourne \u00a3196 while those coming from Southampton, Milton Keynes and Bedford will pay \u00a3194 extra, the Lib Dems said.\n The fare hike, announced by the Department for Transport in December, capped the increase according to the RPI rate of inflation in July which was 3.8 per cent.\n Since then the RPI rate of inflation has surged to more than 7 per cent and is set to rise further in the coming months, according to forecasts from the Bank of England.\n The Government said that by setting the rail fare increase according to the July inflation rate it has saved commuters an even steeper rise in fares. Setting the rail fare increase according to the December rate of inflation for example would have led to a 7.5 per cent fare rise.\n The DfT added that is also delayed the fare rise until March and allowed passengers to renew their annual season tickets for 2022 at the lower prices.\n A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cThis increase balances the needs of the passengers with taxpayers, many of whom don\u2019t use the railways but have helped keep them running during the pandemic.\n \u201cDelaying the changes until March 2022 not only offers the chance to travel for less during January and February but also to save money throughout the year by renewing season tickets at last\u202fyear\u2019s\u202fprice.\u201d\n But Lib Dem transport spokesperson and Richmond Park MP Sarah Olney said: \u201cIt is scandalous to see these price hikes not only in the middle of a cost of living crisis, but also as train companies continue to run patchy timetables. Commuters will be asking, what on earth are we paying for?\n \u201cThousands of commuters will be feeling a sense of dread when they go to renew their season tickets in the coming weeks and months.\u00a0 Freezing rail fares is a no-brainer for the Government. It would be a pro-commuter and pro-business move as the country recovers from the pandemic.\u201d\n Paul Tuohy, Chief Executive of\u00a0Campaign for Better Transport, said: \"As we emerge from the pandemic, our transport system hangs in the balance. To avoid a future of dwindling public transport and surging traffic, the Government should be doing all it can to encourage people back on board trains and buses. Instead, both rail season tickets and TfL fares are about to rise by the highest annual jump for years. \n \u201cThis isn\u2019t good enough. If we want a green, fair recovery, the Government needs to do much more to make public transport the affordable, convenient choice.\" \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/09/10/2a679d08d631c9b6bd053030d029ee88Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ2OTA4NDE2-2.63686974.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Talking Point: What do you think of XR relaunching daily protests?

15 involving cyclists, 10 involving motorbikes or mopeds and three involving pedestrians.\n Some campaigners are concerned that residents are \u201creticent\u201d to treat injuries to cyclists with the same seriousness as those to pedestrians.\n Mr Norman believes that simply installing pedestrian crossings at the three unprotected \u201carms\u201d of the Battersea bridge junction will not address wider safety concerns.\n However, TfL is currently unable to begin work on new road safety schemes due to uncertainty about its long-term financial support from the Government.\n Mr Norman wrote: \u201cTfL is undertaking a further review of the planned pedestrian crossings\u2019 design to explore what other options there are to accelerate cycling safety improvements ahead of any potential westward extension to Cycleway 8, which currently runs along Grosvenor Road to Chelsea Bridge.\n \u201cI feel that this is the right thing to do given the long history of cycling collisions at the junction, and in light of the tragic collision in January.\u201d\n The Battersea bridge junction is one of the 73 high-risk junctions that TfL is committed to improving in the mayor\u2019s \u201cvision zero\u201d action plan to eradicate road deaths by 2041.\n TfL installed a pedestrian crossing on the north side of the bridge last December, in response to a public campaign following Mr Ryan\u2019s death.\n Campaigners have urged TfL to look more widely at the danger from traffic at the junctions with Chelsea, Albert and Battersea bridges \u2013 concerns that date back two decades.\n The Better Streets for Kensington and Chelsea group fears a campaign by Kensington, Chelsea and Fulham Conservatives to reintroduce a banned left turn for traffic heading north over Chelsea bridge could place cyclists in danger.\n In 2017, pregnant schoolteacher Charlotte Landi was killed by a HGV when the driver failed to indicate he was turning left.\n Justin Abbott, of Better Streets for Kensington and Chelsea, told the Standard: \u201cWe hope at a minimum that the recent awful collision - after the death in 2017 of Charlotte Landi by Chelsea Bridge - reminds local politicians of the human cost of not properly regarding the safety of those travelling by bike.\u201d \n David Waddell, chairman of the Cheyne Walk Trust, one of the residents\u2019 groups that raised concerns with TfL, said Mr Norman\u2019s letter \u201cunderstates\u201d the safety problem and \u201coffers no commitment to early resolution and improving safety\u201d.\n He said: \u201cIt has been assessed that a further 72 casualties and two more fatalities can be anticipated over the next five years if the remaining three arms of the junction are left unimproved.\u201d \n  \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/01/09/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "\u00a320,000 reward for information about convenience store killer"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/04/04/18/newFile-2.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Boat Race returns to Thames as Cambridge aim to continue dominance"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/02/15/EKdd-sYXsAAL0cc.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Met Police officer charged with making indecent images of children"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/01/31/12/MG-STK1115_Movember_Campaign_Image_Toolkit_DAVIDANDREW_PEREZ_HIRes_06%281%29.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Closing the cancer care gap "}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/01/21/16/newFile-6.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=806%3A537%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Jack Ryan was hit by a southbound car as he tried to jog across Battersea bridge </p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/tfl-fare-increase-sadiq-khan-tube-buses-cost-of-living-b982465.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "TfL fare increase will \u2018dampen\u2019 London\u2019s economic recovery, Sadiq Khan warned"}, {"author_container": "By    Joe Talora 14 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-14 14:48:55"}, {"article_body": "Increasing TfL fares will \u201cdampen\u201d London\u2019s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, a leading thinktank has warned.\n Mayor of London Sadiq Khanannounced on Monday that TfL fares will rise by 4.8 per cent in March \u2013 the biggest annual jump in more than a decade.\n It comes as part of the emergency funding deal agreed with the Government last June -

The daily cap on multiple pay-as-you-go Tube journeys will face a 3.8 per cent increase, while the daily cap on bus journeys will rise by 30p.\n While TfL reported a 25 per cent jump in Tube passenger numbers since the end of working from home guidance, there is growing concern that ridership will never again reach pre-pandemic levels.\n Even before the announcement of fare increases, TfL commissioner Andy Byford admitted that the \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario going forward is one where \u201cthere would not be a full return to previous levels\u201d of passengers.\n Lib Dem London Assembly member Caroline Pidgeon, who leads the Assembly\u2019s transport committee, said the fare increase is \u201csadly inevitable\u201d but that it is \u201clittle comfort for passengers who will now be facing even higher fares\u201d.\n The fares hike is the latest in a series of blows to low-income Londoners in what has been dubbed a national cost of living crisis.\n As UK inflation jumped to 5.4 per cent in December, significant price increases have been seen in everyday essentials like food as well as fuel and energy. Londoners are also facing higher council tax bills, with Sadiq Khan having announced that the GLA portion of council tax is set to increase by an average of \u00a331.93 a year from next April.\n Trust for London chief executive Manny Hothi has said the cost of living crisis \u201cwill push more Londoners into poverty at a time when we already have the highest rates of poverty in the country\u201d.\n Loading....\n Mr Hothi said: \u201cData from London\u2019s Poverty Profile shows that one in five working Londoners is already living in poverty and pressure is increasing. The hike in tube prices is another increase to the daily cost of living and working in our capital city, added to rising rail prices, inflation, energy costs and taxation. Now is the time for all employers not already paying at least the London living wage to start doing so immediately, and for more Government support to help those already struggling to make ends meet.\u201d\n Next week, the London Assembly will scrutinise the Mayor of London\u2019s budget plans for the upcoming financial year for the final time.

There is a larger wheelchair and buggy area and CCTV cameras have been upgraded to provide higher-definition footage to improve on-board safety.\n The buses have been built in Scarborough by British bus firm Alexander Dennis and are operated by Abellio London under a \u00a37.3m contract.\n TfL chiefs say they have been unable to award new bus contracts since October 31 due to the lack of certainty over funding.\n A total of 25 routes, worth about \u00a3400m, are waiting to be re-tendered, according to TfL deputy commissioner Gareth Powell.\n Contracts are normally awarded nine to 12 months ahead of their introduction and TfL fears the failure to secure a long-term funding deal will soon be noticed by passengers.\n TfL said the new buses on route 63 were \u201ca sign of what the future of buses could be\u201d if financial help was secured to take ageing diesel buses off the road. Passenger numbers on the route are now close to pre-pandemic levels.\n There are now more than 650 zero-exhaust-emission buses in London. TfL aims to convert the whole 9,00-vehicle fleet by 2034 but says this could be done by 2030 with Government support.\n Seb Dance, deputy mayor for Transport, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the introduction of this cleaner, safer and 100 per cent electric bus fleet on route 63. As ridership levels on the route return close to pre-pandemic levels, these new buses will play a significant role in encouraging Londoners back onto our bus network.\n \u201cUnfortunately we will not see more of these buses if TfL goes into managed decline due to lack of funding.\u201d\n Chris Gall, ADL Group Engineering Director, said: \u201cTfL\u2019s sustained investment in its bus network is hugely important as it underpins skilled jobs and apprenticeships at our factories in Yorkshire and Scotland, our aftermarket facilities across the country, as well as in our extensive domestic supply chain.\u201d\n Jon Eardley, Managing Director, Abellio London Bus, said: \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of the quality and comfort that these new zero emission buses offer.\n \u201cWe believe that continued and sustained investment in the capitals zero emission fleet is essential to attract more people to use public transport.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/11/11/USB%20charging%20and%20mobile%20phone%20holder%20on%20seat%20backs.png?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=8081%3A5387%2Csmart", "alt": ""}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/01/09/AFP_32484VJ.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Easter weekend: Which TfL lines are closed and how do I get to Heathrow?"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/05/07/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Easter weekend Tube chaos as TfL announces widespread closures"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/26/10/4f2b03bc59a643f766bf5fb556c774a5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4Mzc1Njc2-2.34275721.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Surge hiring: Uber seeks 20,000 drivers as TfL grants new licence"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/14/GettyImages-1372843736.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "How you can support or sponsor Ukrainians fleeing the war"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/11/11/E-ink%20screen.png?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=7724%3A4602%2Csmart", "alt": ""}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/south-western-railway-omicron-commuter-timetable-b982074.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "South Western Railway to restore timetable following Omicron disruption"}, {"author_container": "By    Joe Talora 11 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-11 11:57:21"}, {"article_body": "Commuter trains into central London are set to return to levels seen last year following disruption caused by the Omicron wave of Covid-19.\n South Western Railway, which operates services to and from London Waterloo, introduced a temporary reduced timetable earlier this year due to staff shortages caused by Covid-19.\n But the operator announced on Friday that, from Monday 21 February, its timetable will be restored to the one last used in December 2021 meaning that several services will be reinstated.\n Four services - the 07:38 from Southampton to Waterloo, the 17:02 Waterloo to Guildford, the 07:00 Shepperton to Waterloo and the 08:15 Waterloo to Waterloo (via Hounslow) - will not return, however.\n South Western\u2019s managing director Claire Mann said it has been a \u201cdifficult period\u201d for the railway and that the operator was left with \u201cno choice but to temporarily reduce [its] timetable\u201d in response to staff shortages in January.\n But Ms Mann said: \u201cWith staff availability now consistently improving, we are pleased to be able to announce this uplift, which will essentially see service levels return to where they were prior to the spread of Omicron.\n \u201cMore and more people are returning to our railway, and this timetable will ensure that we match capacity and demand while delivering reliability for customers\u201d.\n Despite the upcoming uplift in South Western services, the operator is under pressure over its plans to permanently slash its timetable from December 2022.\n Last autumn, South Western opened a consultation on its plans to reduce the number of trains it runs in response to new commuting patterns emerging since the end of lockdown.\n But the plan has been met with backlash from commuters, politicians and transport stakeholders.\n In response to the consultation, transport watchdog London TravelWatch said the cuts were \u201cpremature\u201d and would \u201cdisadvantage those who have no choice but to travel\u201d and \u201cincrease car dependency in outer London\u201d.\n This concern was recently brought up by former London mayoral candidate and Green Party London Assembly member Sian Berry.\n Earlier this month, a YouGov survey commissioned by Ms Berry found that as many as one in four outer Londoners felt \u201cforced\u201d to own a car due to a lack of transport options.\n Ms Berry said that further cuts to suburban rail services would \u201cmake this awful situation of Londoners feeling forced to own a car even worse\u201d and called on the Government and the Mayor of London to ensure that there are adequate public transport options across the whole of the capital.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/15/newFile.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "East London homes get temporary generators after substation fire"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/24/14/PRI216053910.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Highest number of Covid patients in London hospitals for almost two months"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/20/1414418b16e7f3bec3faaf8bee5846e7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4NTc5NjIy-2.59876735.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "High Covid cases not translating into hospitalisations or deaths, says Jenny Harries"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/23/14/GettyImages-1280506989.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "How Jobcentre Plus can put you in touch with the right people"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/tfl-covid-bailout-unacceptable-terms-government-andy-byford-london-sadiq-khan-b981594.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "TfL rejects new Covid bailout over \u2018unacceptable\u2019 terms imposed for extra cash"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 09 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-09 18:14:33"}, {"article_body": "Transport for London failed to agree to a new Covid bailout because of the \u201cunacceptable\u201d conditions attached by the Government, it has been revealed.\n TfL commissioner Andy Byford said he refused to accept the latest deal last Friday \u2014 which would have only lasted until June \u2014 because he was unhappy at the terms being imposed in return for extra cash.\n A two-week extension was instead granted in a bid to find a solution acceptable to both TfL and the Department for Transport.\n Mr Byford told the London Assembly transport committee on Wednesday: \u201cWhat was put before us last Friday was unacceptable in terms of the conditions that were attached.\u201d\n TfL is seeking more than \u00a31\u2009billion until April next year to keep Tube and bus services running \u2014 by which time it is required to break even on a day-to-day basis \u2014 plus a longer-term capital funding for \u201cbig ticket items\u201d such as new trains and signalling systems.\n Mr Byford said he expected a further short-term deal to give the Government extra time to decide how to fund major transport infrastructure projects.\n He said he was \u201cnot expecting a blank cheque\u201d but added: \u201cWhat I don\u2019t support is either a temporary deal that has intolerable, unacceptable conditions.

Both the Government and TfL agreed to a short extension of the current funding deal to ensure the next settlement represents value for money for taxpayers across the country.\n \u201cWe have repeatedly shown our commitment to supporting London\u2019s transport network throughout the pandemic, providing more than \u00a34.5bn in emergency funding to TfL and pledging a further billion pounds of capital investment every year up until at least 2024/25 - all at a time of significant pressure on national finances.\u201d\n Previous bailouts have included conditions such as requiring Mayor Sadiq Khan to review the TfL pension scheme \u2014 sparking a Tube strike on two days next month by the RMT \u2014 and to fund any free travel concessions for children and pensioners from City Hall funds.\n The June deal also required Mr Khan to hike Tube and bus fares by RPI+1 - a condition that was later quietly abandoned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\n The Government\u2019s stance is that it is willing to cover the huge drop in income suffered by TfL due to the pandemic but will not use national funds to subsidise Mr Khan\u2019s \u201cpolicy choices\u201d.\n Mr Shapps, announcing the two-week extension to the Commons on Monday, said that he was aiming to secure a \u201crobust\u201d deal by February 18.\n Mr Shapps said: \u201c\u201cThis short extension will enable us to finalise the terms of a robust settlement for this period, ensuring TfL and the Mayor take steps to move towards financial sustainability.\n \u201cSupport to TfL has always been on the condition that TfL reaches financial sustainability as soon as possible and with a target date of April 2023, and government continues to press the Mayor of London and TfL to take the decisions needed to put the organisation on a sustainable footing.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/26/10/4f2b03bc59a643f766bf5fb556c774a5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4Mzc1Njc2-2.34275721.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Surge hiring: Uber seeks 20,000 drivers as TfL grants new licence"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/04/14/497aca9d076308f208e5302db1bb985dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ2NDg4OTc3-2.64802743.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "The Leader podcast: London\u2019s Covid-19 spike and TfL\u2019s travel risk u-turn"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/22/09/d7d52ba24f5f18b2b616d59497769bfaY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4MDI1OTY4-2.53188618.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Outer London needs levelling up"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/08/12/Secret_Cinema_-_Bridgerton_-_16th_February_2022_by_Luke_Dyson_-_LD2_0032.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Bridgerton fans: don\u2019t miss this immersive Secret Cinema experience"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/tfl-drivers-speed-limits-20mph-fines-b981685.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "20mph speed limits to be rolled out on more London roads, TfL announces"}, {"author_container": "By    Joe Talora 09 February 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-02-09 18:12:45"}, {"article_body": "Lower speed limits are to be introduced on more roads across London in a bid to cut the number of injuries and deaths, Transport for London has announced.\n A new 20mph speed limit will be introduced on the A10 to A503 corridor in Haringey, the A13 Commercial Road in Tower Hamlets, the A23 London Road in Croydon and the A107 corridor in Hackney, while the speed limit will be reduced to 30mph on the A10 Great Cambridge Road in Enfield.\n It forms part of the Mayor of London\u2019s \u201cVision Zero\u201d target of eliminating all serious injury and death from London\u2019s roads by 2041.\n TfL has committed to reducing speed limits to 20mph on all 220 kilometres of the TfL road network by 2024, and already introduced the lower limit on all its roads within the Congestion Charge zone in March 2020.\n Lili Matson, TfL\u2019s chief health, safety and environment officer, said that the new speed limits \u201cwill not only save lives\u201d but will also \u201cencourage Londoners in these communities to travel in more active and sustainable ways\u201d.\n She said: \u201cWe are determined to eliminate deaths and serious injuries from London\u2019s roads in line with our Vision Zero goal.

Professor Tyler said the study would draw on the \u201cevolution of human hearing\u201d and how the brain is able to draw on small sounds to alert the eye to potential danger.\n Several options were likely to be suggested, with the scooter firms and Transport for London left to choose their favourite.\n \u201cOne of the interesting things is that a sound doesn\u2019t need to be loud, it just needs to be distinctive, for example the snapping of a twig,\u201d Professor Tyler said.\n \u201cWe would want to place it at a frequency and loudness that is less than the loudness of the traffic. The idea is that it would be a distinctive sound but not add to the urban cacophony.\u201d\n He added: \u201cThere are a lot of people very worried by scooters. I think the problem is that people have an experience of being surprised by a scooter coming past them from behind. That kind of surprise is quite shocking.\u201d\n Concerns have been expressed since the launch of the London hire e-scooters last June that pedestrians, and in particular blind people, are at risk of being involved in a collision because the devices are virtually silent.\n A total of 14 serious injuries - including two to pedestrians - have been reported by the operators involved in the London trials, which are taking place across 10 boroughs including Camden, Westminster, Ealing and Richmond. \n Separate UK-wide data from the Department for Transport shows that in the year to last June, 131 pedestrians were injured in e-scooter collisions, primarily those that are privately owned and illegal to ride on public roads and pavements.\n Three people were killed riding private e-scooters in London last year. Two were thought to have been involved in collisions with a car while the third victim is believed to have fallen from his e-scooter. \n More than 585,000 trips have been made on the capital\u2019s fleet of almost 3,600 e-scooters since the trial launched last June.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/15/newFile-1.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Over 130 e-bike and e-scooter battery fires in just over a year"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/24/14/PRI216053910.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Highest number of Covid patients in London hospitals for almost two months"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/20/1414418b16e7f3bec3faaf8bee5846e7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4NTc5NjIy-2.59876735.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "High Covid cases not translating into hospitalisations or deaths, says Jenny Harries"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/01/28/12/Turkaegean_Orange_11648x8736px.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Why the Turkish Aegean needs to be on your holiday radar"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/travelwatch-survey-women-travel-night-safety-concerns-sarah-everard-sabrina-nessa-b978649.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Nearly half of women avoid travel at certain times for fear of their safety"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 25 January 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-01-25 12:30:40"}, {"article_body": "Almost half of women say they have stopped travelling in London at certain times of the day due to concerns about personal safety.\n The findings, from research by the passenger watchdog London TravelWatch, came in the wake of the night-time killings of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa.\n Concerns are increasing that safety fears could become more acute if the Government fails to award Transport for London a long-term funding deal next week, as off-peak bus and Tube services would face the axe under cost-saving plans. \n Tuesday\u2019s report found 23 per cent of passengers - and 48 per cent of women respondents - no longer travelled at certain times of the day due to safety concerns.\n Almost three quarters of respondents - the research questioned more than 1,000 passengers and a focus group of young women - said after 10pm was the least safe time to travel.\n The report called on TfL to fully restore Night Tube services as soon as possible, for weekend Night buses to be protected from any cuts and an assurance that bus frequencies will not drop below one every 12 minutes.\n Research from the Young Women\u2019s Trust found that 16 per cent of young women had been unable to apply for a jab, turned down a job or left a job because the journey to and from work wasn\u2019t safe.\n London TravelWatch director Emma Gibson said: \u201cNobody wants to wait any longer than they have to for a bus, Tube or train, but this research shows a clear link between bus and Tube frequency and personal security concerns, particularly late at night amongst women and girls, older and disabled people and people of colour. Having staff at stations also makes people feel safer. \n \u201cWith a decision on TfL\u2019s funding being made next week, it\u2019s a timely reminder that keeping night-time transport frequent avoids people spending more time than they need to at dark bus stops or deserted platforms and makes them feel safer when travelling in the capital. \n \u201cIt\u2019s really important that TfL fully restores Night Tube services as soon as possible and resists the temptation to cut back weekend night buses as not everyone can afford a taxi or Uber when they need to get home late at night.\u201d\n Fewer than five buses an hour means that a service is no longer regarded as \u201cturn up and go\u201d and would leave passengers potentially waiting at isolated bus stops for a considerable period.\n Only two of the five Night Tube lines - the Victoria and Central - have been relaunched, and train frequencies have been hit by an ongoing strike by RMT drivers.\n The RMT is also threatening separate action over the loss of between 500 and 600 posts across the Tube network due to TfL\u2019s financial crisis.\n The report said the long-term funding crisis faced by TfL and national rail services was \u201cconcerning\u201d from a personal security perspective.\n It said: \u201cFirstly, more frequent services reduces the risk of passengers being left stranded or waiting for a long time in dark, unfamiliar stations.\n \u201cSecondly, the overall efficiency and reliability of the network has a significant impact on how safe passengers feel.\n \u201cWhen we spoke to young women in particular, not only did they want staff to be present, they wanted staff levels to increase.\u201d\n Overall, the report found that 79 per cent of passengers felt very or fairly safe on the capital\u2019s public transport network.\n Only seven per cent felt fairly or very unsafe, though women were twice as likely to feel unsafe than men.\n There was majority support for an app to report crime or unsafe behaviour on public transport. Many passengers assume that by the time they leave the Tube, bus or train it is too late to report an incident, the report said.\n The BTP is due to launch such an app this year, with TfL said to be watching the impact, having paused the inclusion of such a function on its TfL Go app.\n Crime levels on public transport fell by 52 per cent in 2020/21, compared with the previous year, due to the pandemic.\n Of the 19,521 crimes recorded on TfL services, nine out of 10 were on the Tube or bus. Sexual offences were down 71 per cent on the Tube to 311 incidents, and down by 59 per cent on the buses to 754 incidents.\n There were 212 robberies on the Tube and 979 on the buses, both down more than 40 per cent.\n A TfL spokesman said: \u201c The safety of women and girls is\u00a0an absolute priority for us.\u00a0We recognise\u00a0women\u2019s concerns about safety and continue to invest in transport policing\u00a0to prevent and tackle sexual offences. \n \u201cWe are also running a public awareness\u00a0campaign to\u00a0highlight what constitutes\u00a0sexual harassment.\u00a0A\u00a0near normal Night Tube service is operating each weekend on the Victoria\u00a0line, with a reduced but regular service on the Central line through central London, and we\u00a0are working hard to\u00a0resume services on the remaining Night Tube lines\u00a0as soon as possible.\u00a0The Night Overground and our extensive night bus network also continue to operate.\u201d \n"}, {"images":

discouraged from returning to work if the Government fails to keep the Tube and bus network running at full capacity, Sadiq Khan has warned.\n The mayor said this week\u2019s decision to axe the \u201cwork from home if you can\u201d advice added to pressure on ministers to secure a long-term funding deal for Transport for London.\n It came as reductions in commuter trains run by South Western Railway into Waterloo left key workers \u201cstranded\u201d and unable to balance childcare with their return to work, according to London MP Sarah Olney.\n TfL\u2019s current deal runs out on February 4, with it preparing to enter a \u201cmanaged decline\u201d scenario that could include cuts of up to 18 per cent in bus services and nine per cent on the Tube. \n Thursday morning saw an immediate jump in Tube journeys as Londoners headed back to the office, up eight per cent on a week earlier. \n Mr Khan said: \u201cAre you going to be encouraged and enticed to come back to the office if there is 10 per cent fewer buses or 20 per cent fewer Tubes and you can\u2019t get the quality of service you have been used to?\n \u201cWe need people to return to the office because that helps our economy, helps mentoring and creativity.\u201d\n Ms Olney, the Lib-Dem transport spokeswoman and MP for Richmond Park, said a reduced timetable introduced by South Western Railway on Monday had caused her constituents problems.\n \u201cOur city should be opening up but instead rail operators and the Government seem hell-bent on making life even harder for businesses and commuters,\u201d she said.\n The requirement to wear a face mask on TfL services will become a \u201ccondition of carriage\u201d when the legal requirement ends next Thursday.\n A weekly survey by Transport Focus and London TravelWatch on Friday found that 72 per cent of passengers felt safer if others wore face coverings.\n Mr Khan said: \u201cI worry about people who may now catch the virus because people next to them aren\u2019t wearing a face mask\u2026 or they themselves, because they\u2019re not wearing a face mask, may be more susceptible to catch it.\u201d\n A KMPG study commissioned by the Government last year into TfL\u2019s long-term financial sustainability, at a cost of \u00a31.2m, remains secret, despite requests from MPs and TfL for it to be made public.\n Transport minister Trudy Harrison said: \u201cThe Government will continue to monitor the public interest test for when publication might be appropriate.\u201d\n Ms Olney said: \u201cPiecemeal, short-term settlements will not be sufficient and many fear this is exactly the conclusion the KPMG report reached.\n \u201cWe need a fully informed debate around how TfL can get back on its feet and survive for years to come. That makes the release of the report, even in redacted form, absolutely essential.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/01/00/7dfb1f758a10a0c86afca964813c5e3cY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4ODU0NTcw-2.65497499.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Energy price cap rises due, but what other costs are set to go up?"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/01/00/b06b8a2608c64ada1d6eed58625b4ebcY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4ODIwMTQz-2.55050274.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Drivers warned to expect \u2018avalanche\u2019 of yellow box junction rules"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/04/01/00/46eb3b75806b35c09fd0ee084f247976Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4ODMzMDYz-2.65887371.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "MPs to stage inquiry into Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s detention in Iran"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/04/11/Mugla_Dalyan_Canal_morass_6720x4480px%20%281%29.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Why you need to explore T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Dalaman region for yourself "}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/night-tube-strike-london-why-tfl-victoria-central-line-weekend-rmt-b967597.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "London Tube Strike: Which TfL lines are affected and why are there strikes every weekend for 6 months?"}, {"author_container": "By    Sami Quadri Barney Davis @BarneyDavisES 21 January 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-01-21 11:15:11"}, {"article_body": "Commuters are set to face further travel chaos in the New Year after the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) voted for a six-month strike from January 7.\n Transport chiefs have said they are \u201cdisappointed\u201d at the planned strikes, warning it will \u201ccause unnecessary disruption\u201d\n What dates and times are the strikes planned?\n The RMT action will see its members conduct a walk-out on the Victoria and Central lines from 8.30pm on Friday until 8am on Saturday, and from 8.30pm on Saturday until 8am on Sunday.\n Set to be the longest strike in London Underground history, it will take place from Friday January 7 and continue each weekend until June.\n Industrial action previously took place on the Victoria and Central lines earlier this month.\n It was followed with drivers on the Northern, Piccadilly and Jubilee lines also staging a walk out for 24 hours \u2013 meaning five Underground lines had fewer or no trains on the final Saturday before Christmas.\n Why is the RMT striking?\n TfL announced London\u2019s round-the-clock Night Tube service would resume from November 27 on the Victoria and Central lines.\n The east-west Central Line and north-south Victoria Lines were set to operate overnight on Fridays and Saturdays each week.\n Drivers will be rostered to work up to four night shift weekends per year, Andy Lord, London Underground\u2019s managing director, said on January 7.\n But the RMT says the rota changes have resulted in \u201cunacceptable and intolerable demands\u201d on its members and their work-life balance.\n Following the first batch of strike action, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said members had remained \u201csolid and determined\u201d.\n \u201cThis issue isn\u2019t going away,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWith action scheduled for the next six months there is only one way forward and that\u2019s for serious and genuine talks aimed at a negotiated settlement.\u201d\n It claimed TfL bosses rejected its offer to suspend strike action. \n Which lines will be impacted by the latest strike?\n RMT members will stage a walkout on two Night Tube lines every weekend evening \u2013 the Victoria and Central line. \n The RMT has not ruled out strikes on other lines if Underground bosses don\u2019t meet its demands, saying its legal mandate to strike extended to other Tube lines.\n Loading....\n This means although they\u2019re not facing strike action, the large-scale protest is expected to have a knock-on effect on other lines on the network.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/11/22/09/AFP_9QA2MD.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "London Tube Strike: How to get around London without five Tube lines "}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/london-tube-underground-strike-yougov-poll-widespread-opposition-rmt-sadiq-khan-b977993.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "London Tube strike rumbles on despite widespread opposition"}, {"author_container": "By    David Bond Deputy Political Editor @djbond6873 21 January 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-01-21 09:49:58"}, {"article_body": "Union bosses are pressing ahead with the longest Tube strike in history in the face of widespread opposition from Londoners, a new poll reveals.\n Fifty per cent of adults in London are against the industrial action, according to the survey by YouGov. Of that number, 30 per cent said they strongly oppose the strikes.\n The poll also found that 28 per cent of Londoners supported the move but that only nine per cent strongly supported the action.\n Unless a deal can be agreed between the union and Transport for London, RMT Tube drivers on the Victoria and Central lines will walk out from 8.30pm each Friday and Saturday night, until 4.29am the following morning for the next six months. The next round of industrial action is due to start on Friday and end on Sunday morning.\n The strike has been criticised by business chiefs for holding back the capital\u2019s economic recovery as it tries to bounce back from the pandemic.\n Richard Burge, Chief Executive of London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, called the RMT \u201cobstructive and selfish\u201d and implored the union to \u201cput their shoulder to the wheel and show solidarity with businesses and Londoners\u201d.\n Muniya Barua, Managing Director for Strategy and Policy at business campaign group London First, urged the two sides to \u201cget back round the table quickly\u201d.\n She added: \u201cLondoners depend on a regular underground service and for many the Night Tube is a lifeline, not just a Tube line. This action will have major consequences for the economic recovery at the very point that commuters will be returning to their offices.\u201d\n Kate Nichols, Chief Executive of UKHospitality, said the Night Tube was vital to pubs, restaurants and nightclubs which had already been hammered by the pandemic and a series of Covid lockdowns.\n \u201cA strike would jeopardise hospitality business, jobs, livelihoods and peoples\u2019 safety. The Tube is crucial for safely transporting staff and customers - often women and vulnerable people late at night - to and from venues.\n \u201cHospitality has suffered two disastrous years of closure and low trading but will be key to London\u2019s recovery. The last thing London needs is new setbacks like this.\u201d\n The RMT, which initiated the action in the run-up to Christmas in protest at rotas which will require all Tube drivers to work four night shifts a year, insists it acted to protect safety standards and its members\u2019 work-life balance.\n Connor Ibbetson from YouGov: \u201cAs we emerge from Covid, more and more Londoners are likely to start making the night tube a part of their lives again. These results show that while half of people in the capital oppose the strike, a notable number back it.\n \u201cWhile Conservative-voting Londoners are much more likely to be against this industrial action, it is a more balanced equation among both Labour and Lib Dem supporters.\u201d\n The Night Tube, which used to operate on five lines, was closed by TfL after the pandemic struck in March 2020. It returned on just two lines - the Central and Victoria lines - on November 27.\n London Mayor Sadiq Khan came under pressure in the autumn to restart the night tube in the wake of concerns over women\u2019s safety following the murders of Sabina Nessa and Sarah Everard.\n However the YouGov poll shows greater opposition to the night Tube strike among men, with 54 per cent saying they are against the action, compared to 47 per cent of women.\n Perhaps surprisingly the age group most opposed to the industrial action was the over 65s with 62 per cent saying they were against the strikes. By contrast only 42 per cent of those aged 18-24 were opposed while 48 per cent of 25-49 year olds were against the action.\n Both TfL and the RMT say they remained open to talks to try and bring the strikes to an early end but one official said the negotiations had reached a \u201cbit of a stalemate\u201d.\n A spokesperson for TfL said: \u201cWe completely understand how frustrating the RMT\u2019s six months of planned disruption is for our customers.\n \u201cDespite the action, we\u2019re running a good Night Tube service on the Victoria line and a regular service on the Central line, with at least two trains per hour through central London.\u201d\n RMT general Secretary Mick Lynch said: \u201cNaturally Londoners don\u2019t want strikes on their Tube services and nor do we. We have offered suspensions of action and resolution to the dispute but LU Management have rejected them time and again..\n \u201cOur members voted for this action in defence of agreements, for a work/life balance and for safe working conditions by an overwhelming majority.\n \u201cIt is now time for Mayor Khan to instruct his management team to get on with resolving it and we remain available for discussions.\u201d\n YouGov interviewed 1,115 adults in London between January 7 and 10.

This ensures the rules are clear and consistent and crucially means enforcement action can continue to be carried out on our transport network. Compliance of the rules is far higher with legislation than without.\n \u201cIf we have learnt anything from this pandemic, it is that we must not get complacent and undo all our hard work and sacrifices. That\u2019s why face coverings will remain a condition of carriage on TfL services. I\u2019m asking everyone in our capital to do the right thing and continue to wear a face covering when travelling on TfL services to keep us all protected and to prevent further restrictions from being necessary later down the line.\u201d\n While face coverings are a condition of carriage, Londoners can be turned away from TfL services by one of the 500 enforcement officers across London\u2019s transport network, but they will no longer face fines.\n Removing the legal requirement to wear a mask also means that British Transport Police will no longer be able to enforce mask wearing on public transport.\n Between July and September 2021, before face coverings once again became a legal requirement, TfL reported that compliance with mask rules was beginning to fall but just 220 people were turned away from services for failing to comply with the rules.\n But between the introduction of Plan B measures on November 30 and January 18, there were 1,810 people who received fines for not wearing a face covering, while 1,013 people were asked to leave services for refusing to comply with the rules on face coverings.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/12/09_Jan_JS_London_54.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "24-hour Tube strikes cost TfL \u00a313 million in lost fares"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/13/2de9f0e2aa020d7b20046197d3a34e84Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4NTUyNjYx-2.65645264.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "New Met Police Commissioner to be appointed in the summer"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/11/13/0a3849c7ecdfc6ed66b123eccb515e86Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ0NjcxNTY2-2.55734824.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Patel orders review into way Khan ousted Dame Cressida as Met boss"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/01/31/12/MG-STK1115_Movember_Campaign_Image_Toolkit_DAVIDANDREW_PEREZ_HIRes_06%281%29.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Closing the cancer care gap "}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/tfl-transport-for-london-staff-changes-andy-byford-vernon-everitt-mark-wild-b977607.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Big changes at top of TfL as executive team reduced"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 19 January 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-01-19 15:26:43"}, {"article_body": "A reshuffle at the top of Transport for London will see a long-serving executive depart and the chief executive of Crossrail leave once the line opens.\n Details emerged on Wednesday afternoon of changes instigated by TfL commissioner Andy Byford as he sought to streamline the cash-strapped organisation, prepare it for future challenges and the post-pandemic recovery and boost staff morale.\n Vernon Everitt, who was TfL\u2019s pandemic \u201crecovery\u201d director and previously held a key role in preparing for the 2012 Olympics, will leave after 14 years.\n It was also confirmed that Mark Wild, the former Tube boss who became Crossrail chief executive, will leave once the line opens \u2013 which it is due to do by the end of June. \n Mr Wild was the highest earner in TfL last year, taking home almost \u00a3450,000 as he battled to keep Crossrail\u2019s construction on track during the pandemic. \n Earlier this month it was confirmed that TfL\u2019s chief finance officer Simon Kilonback, a key figure in negotiating TfL\u2019s Government bail-outs, is to leave in April. \n Mr Byford is reducing the size of his executive team from 11 to seven members, with the changes effective from February 1.\n Three or four of the seven will receive pay rises \u2013 with details to be published in due course \u2013 but the overall wage bill will reduce.\n Gareth Powell, currently in charge of surface transport, is the biggest winner, becoming chief customer and strategy officer and deputy TfL commissioner, the first person to hold the latter role.

It may be difficult to predict at this stage but an assurance that we will be kept updated is required.\n \u201cAll Londoners look forward to their first trip on an Elizabeth Line train and we all hope that this long overdue project will be up and running as planned, early next year.\u201d\n Mr Byford told the Standard on Wednesday that he was confident that final costs could be brought closer to \u00a3825m and insisted there was no threat of blowing the \u00a31.1bn maximum allowed.\n Crossrail said the mass tests would use volunteers from TfL, Crossrail, contractors and partner organisations.\n A TfL spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain vigilant to any Covid-19 developments and are very mindful of protecting our staff and volunteers. Every attendee will be required to take a lateral flow test and face coverings will be required throughout exercises. Participants will not attend exercises if they feel unwell or have been instructed to isolate.\n \u201cThe Elizabeth line is extremely complex, and the trial operations phase will continue until it is clear that the highest levels of safety and reliability are in place before the railway can open to customers.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/17/newFile.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "The most affordable shared ownership homes available across London now"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/homesandproperty/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/09/10/Elizabethlinetrain.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Here\u2019s everything we know so far about the Elizabeth line launch"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/24/14/PRI216053910.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Highest number of Covid patients in London hospitals for almost two months"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/04/11/Mugla_Dalyan_Canal_morass_6720x4480px%20%281%29.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Why you need to explore T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Dalaman region for yourself "}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/more-than-two-million-londoners-face-paying-sadiq-khan-clean-air-charge-ulez-b977398.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "More than two million in London would have to pay proposed \u2018clean air charge\u2019, analysis suggests"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 19 January 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-01-19 07:14:36"}, {"article_body": "More than two million London households face having to pay Sadiq Khan\u2019s proposed \u201cclean air charge\u201d, research by the Evening Standard suggests.\n These are largely in the suburbs, with nine outer London boroughs each having more than 100,000 cars registered \u2013 including Conservative-voting areas such as Bromley, Barnet and Hillingdon.\n The Labour mayor is considering whether to slap a levy of up to \u00a32 a day on motorists driving a petrol or diesel car by May 2024.\n This is one of four options under consideration in a bid to cut the number of car journeys in the capital by 27 per cent by the end of the decade to improve the environment.\n A total of 2,620,600 cars were registered to a London address by the end of September 2021, according to the latest Department for Transport statistics.\n Only about two per cent of these are hybrid or electric cars, which Mr Khan says would be exempt from the new levy.\n He wants to encourage more Londoners to walk or cycle short journeys, take the bus or switch to electric car.\n While some low-income Londoners and disabled Londoners would be expected to qualify for a discount or full exemption, the impact of the levy would be far-reaching.\n Out-of-town motorists driving into London in a petrol or diesel car would also have to pay. Transport for London\u2019s annual Travel in London document estimates there are about 2.1m car journeys a day in and out of London.\n The DfT data shows that Bromley has the highest car ownership, with 147,300 vehicles. It is followed by Barnet (141,700), Croydon (140,900), Hillingdon (133,500) and Enfield (119,500).\n Bexley, Havering, Redbridge and Ealing also have more than 100,000 cars registered to local addresses.\n Overall, more than 1.9m cars are registered to homes in outer London and 713,500 to homes in inner London.\n Across London, 56 per cent of households have access to a car, including 12 per cent who own two or more cars.\n But Mr Khan says the decision to target motorists is a \u201cmatter of social justice\u201d because the poorest Londoners either don\u2019t have cars or live in the most polluted areas.\n The mayor says Londoners needing to drive should switch to an electric or hybrid car. These are soaring in popularity, with almost 16,000 bought by Londoners last year, often to evade the \u00a312.50-a-day expanded ultra-low emission zone. But their supply is being restricted by global shortages of semi-conductors due to the pandemic.\n Mr Khan told Sky News: \u201cWe have got to cut congestion, because too many Londoners spend too much time stuck in their cars stuck in traffic.\n \u201cThe average Londoner that drives spends almost six days [a year] stuck in their car \u2013 150 hours.\n \u201cI\u2019m going to try to encourage Londoners\u2026 over the next eight or nine years, to have about a quarter \u2013 27 per cent - fewer journeys in their cars.\u201d\n But research commissioned by City Hall warns that \u201cgreening\u201d the capital\u2019s cars could take more than a decade.\n The report, by Element Energy, says that \u201csome fossil fuel vehicles remain [in London by] 2030 under all scenarios\u201d being considered by the mayor.\n It adds: \u201cTo ensure rapid electrification of the fleet, widespread scrappage (or age limit restrictions on vehicles travelling in London) of all petrol and diesel cars and vans over 10 years old is required.\u201d\n In addition, the switch to electric would create the need for 34,000 to 40,000 public chargers by 2030, of which, 4,000-5,000 could be rapid (50 kW and above) chargers.\n RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: \u201cWe all want to see cleaner air and cleaner vehicles on the road and it\u2019s right the mayor has ambitions to reduce emissions from road transport but these proposals could be beyond the means of many and will punish those who simply cannot afford an electric car.\n \u201cOur research suggests fewer than a third of drivers in London expect to switch to an electric vehicle within the next five years.\u201d\n By the end of last September, there were 32m cars registered in Britain. Between July and September, 83,000 ultra low emission vehicles (ULEVs) were bought - an increase of 40 per cent on the same period a year earlier, and making up almost one in six new registrations.\n More battery electric (BEV) cars (51,000) were registered for the first time in Britain during this period than diesel cars (35,000).\n Petrol and diesel car registrations fell 41 per cent and 66 per cent, while sales of \u201cgreen\u201d cars - Hybrid Electric (HEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric (PHEVs), and Battery Electric (BEVs) - all increased.\n However, petrol cars were still dominant \u2013and accounted for more than half of new registrations.\n A total of 213,000 were registered, compared with 76,000 HEV cars, 51,000 BEV cars and 29,000 PHEV cars.\n Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) include models such as Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and BMW I3S REX. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) include the Tesla Model 3 and Nissan Leaf. Hybrid Electric Vehicles include older versions of the Toyota Prius. \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/05/04/12/GettyImages-1212837255%20%281%29.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Middle earners hit by Covid pandemic income blow"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/31/11/d637cae00bae49bee20162c7f76acc0fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4ODA1Nzg0-2.65317777.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Energy websites crash amid rush to submit meter readings ahead of price hike"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/31/08/fe4cd790201fbc7eb0b48c113d11b0c7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4NzU4NzAy-2.65069438.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Urgent warning to check meters before 54% jump in energy prices"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/02/13/Screenshot%202022-03-02%20at%2012.06.10.png?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Can remote prostate cancer monitoring improve men\u2019s quality of life?"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/01/06/07/ff119fb55e86fbb9ebc672ac38bdcc2aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQxNTM3Nzc4-2.61421678.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=4252%3A2794%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Air pollution is estimated to have killed 1.8 million people in 2019 alone (Nick Ansell/PA)</p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/crossrail-elizabeth-line-opening-date-london-june-2022-tfl-sadiq-khan-b977295.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "1/10Crossrail: Liverpool Street Elizabeth Line"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 18 January 2022"}, {"post_date": "2022-01-18 11:02:10"}, {"article_body": "Crossrail chiefs insisted on Tuesday that the long-awaited line remained on course to open by the end of June.\n Mass evacuation test events \u2013 which will involve thousands of volunteers role-playing to test the emergency response \u2013 are due to be held at the over the coming weekends.\n Transport for London said \u201csignificant progress\u201d was made over Christmas and the \u201ctrial operations\u201d phase, which began on November 20, saw upgrades to train and signalling software and tunnel fire safety schemes.\n A precise opening date has yet to be announced but TfL commissioner Andy Byford said he would not allow the line \u2013 which will be renamed the Elizabeth line when services start running \u2013 to open until he was sure it was reliable.\n Originally due to have been opened by the Queen in December 2018, Crossrail has gone billions over budget, with the total cost now in excess of \u00a320 billion.\n Last week it emerged that the impact of the pandemic is expected to cost it about \u00a31 billion in lost fares in its first three years, due to the increase in commuters working from home and fewer visitors to central London.\n The trial operations phase, which involves running 12 trains an hour between Paddington and Abbey Wood, is about 40 per cent complete.\n Eight of the 10 new stations are complete, with Canary Wharf station due to be handed over in a matter of weeks. However, Bond Street station is around three months behind schedule.\n Mayor Sadiq Khan said: \u201cThe Elizabeth line will transform travel across London and the South East.

\u00a33.50-a-day \u201cboundary charge\u201d to drive into London was reignited today as Transport for London said it needed up to \u00a33bn a year to prevent the capital\u2019s \u201cdecline\u201d.\n The idea of imposing a daily levy on out-of-town motorists crossing the Greater London boundary - which could include a higher \u00a35.50 daily rate for more polluting vehicles - was first proposed by Mayor Sadiq Khan last December.\n Transport Secretary Grant Shapps made clear his opposition to the plan in June, saying it would be wrong to impose a \u201cboundary tax\u201d on non-Londoners to pay for services mainly enjoyed by Londoners.\n But today the option - which could potentially raise \u00a3500m a year - was included in a TfL list of money-raising options submitted to the Government\u2019s spending review.\n The boundary charge was referred to as \u201canother source [of income] identified by the Mayor, on which separate work is ongoing\u201d.\n An accompanying paper being presented to TfL\u2019s finance committee makes clear that the \u201cGreater London Boundary Charge (GLBC) subject to full assessment, consultation and Mayoral decision\u201d remains an option.\n Mr Khan\u2019s preference is for City Hall rather than the Treasury to receive the \u00a3500m a year paid by the capital\u2019s motorists in vehicle excise duty (VED). However, this has previously been rejected by the Government.\n Today\u2019s TfL submission seeks a further \u00a31.7bn covid bail-out over the next 18 months, by which time it hopes to \u201cbreak even\u201d. \n But it would still need \u00a32.5bn-\u00a33bn a year for \u201cinvestment funding\u201d to modernise the road and rail network, about half of which TfL would aim to generate itself.\n The spending review is due to take place on October 27.\n TfL\u2019s \u201cwish list\u201d for funding includes \u00a370m a year until 2026 to modernise the signalling on the Piccadilly line, to enable 36 trains an hour at peak times.\n It also wants \u00a370m a year for three years to start the process of buying 2,150 electric buses and \u00a3125m a year for \u201chealthy streets and active travel\u201d, namely better pavements and cycle lanes.\n TfL has already been forced to abandon long-term projects such as Crossrail 2, the Bakerloo line extension, capacity upgrades to the Northern and Jubilee lines, a cycling and walking bridge at Rotherhithe and the extension of the Croydon tram to Sutton due to a lack of cash.\n TfL commissioner Andy Byford warned the Government that without a long-term funding deal, TfL would have to move to a \u201cmanaged decline\u201d scenario. \n This would mean ditching new projects and only having enough money to undertake repair work on a \u201cskeleton\u201d network of roads and Underground deemed essential to maintain safety.\n Mr Byford said: \u201cWe would have to retreat from running a network that is fit for London, to instead focusing only on the core, legal responsibilities of maintaining a safe and operable skeleton network.\n \u201cThis would prevent the economic recovery that is needed and lead to an increase in car use, thereby unravelling the air quality and road safety advances we have seen and removing any possibility of achieving the mode shift required to support the Government and mayoral carbon targets.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/26/10/4f2b03bc59a643f766bf5fb556c774a5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4Mzc1Njc2-2.34275721.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Surge hiring: Uber seeks 20,000 drivers as TfL grants new licence"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/04/14/497aca9d076308f208e5302db1bb985dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ2NDg4OTc3-2.64802743.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "The Leader podcast: London\u2019s Covid-19 spike and TfL\u2019s travel risk u-turn"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/22/09/d7d52ba24f5f18b2b616d59497769bfaY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4MDI1OTY4-2.53188618.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Outer London needs levelling up"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/01/31/12/MG-STK1115_Movember_Campaign_Image_Toolkit_DAVIDANDREW_PEREZ_HIRes_06%281%29.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Closing the cancer care gap "}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/03/04/09/DTUP_exterior_FD_01_JH2-lower20res.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=786%3A524%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>TfL needs a new signalling system to run the new Piccadilly line trains at higher frequencies </p>"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2020/11/25/11/Andy%20Byford.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=640%3A427%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>TfL commissioner Andy Byford: warned of a \u2018managed decline\u2019 </p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/transport/tube-face-mask-covid-london-underground-enforcement-sadiq-khan-b957148.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "\u2018Covid lottery\u2019 on Tube as face mask use falls"}, {"author_container": "By    Joe Talora Ross Lydall @RossLydall 24 September 2021"}, {"post_date": "2021-09-24 13:00:51"}, {"article_body": "Sadiq Khan admitted that passengers faced a \u201clottery\u201d of catching Covid on the Tube and buses due to declining rates of mask-wearing.\n The Mayor said on Friday the Government\u2019s decision to axe the legal requirement to wear a face covering on public transport increased the risk for commuters on increasingly busy services. Wearing a mask, though, was made a condition of carriage for passengers using public transport in London.\n Mr Khan told BBC London: \u201cI continue to lobby the Government to either make it a national requirement, so we can use the police to enforce this and issue fines, or to give us the powers to issue a by-law.\n \u201cAt the moment, we are not getting the help from the Government we need. As a consequence, people who can\u2019t keep their social distance and have to use public transport are taking a lottery with the chances of potentially catching it.\u201d \n Transport for London is upping efforts to encourage mask-wearing in recognition that \u201ccompliance is beginning to fall\u201d. \n Transport Support Enforcement (TSE) officers were out in force at Liverpool Street station during rush hour on Wednesday in a bid to remind commuters that masks must still be worn on TfL services. \n But with it no longer a legal requirement, police cannot enforce mask-wearing and those who refuse will no longer be fined or prosecuted. \n Siwan Hayward, TfL\u2019s director of compliance, police operations and security, said that this has had an impact on compliance in London. \n She said: \u201cSince the Government removed the legal requirement to wear a face covering, compliance is beginning to fall. When it was a legal requirement, it\u2019s clear that the risk of being fined or being prosecuted did drive-up the level of compliance.\u201d\n Customer research carried out between July 25 and August 21 found that 82 per cent of passengers said they were continuing to wear a mask, though TfL staff and stakeholders have noticed compliance falling below this level.\n TfL employs around 500 people who enforce mask-wearing, including TSE officers, operations officers and revenue control inspectors, who usually stop fare-dodgers. \n Ms Hayward said that enforcement officers make a \u201creally huge effort\u201d but that \u201cyou\u2019re not going to see compliance officers everywhere all the time\u201d. \n She added: \u201cWe are also reminding customers through our announcements, through our media and marketing that it is still a requirement to wear a face covering on public transport and we are asking all Londoners to continue to do the right thing.\u201d\n With several TSE officers stationed in front of the barriers at Liverpool Street on Wednesday, the majority of passengers entered wearing a face covering or put one on when asked. Luca, one of the officers, handed out masks to passengers who did not have one and said that refusing entry was a \u201clast resort\u201d.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/12/09_Jan_JS_London_54.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "24-hour Tube strikes cost TfL \u00a313 million in lost fares"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/23/10/AFP_324B3AQ.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "London Tube drivers in line for big pay rise from April"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/03/14/INDUSTRY%20Tube%20%2008452542.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Mayor Sadiq Khan defends bumper pay hike for London Underground staff"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/01/28/12/Turkaegean_Orange_11648x8736px.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Why the Turkish Aegean needs to be on your holiday radar"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/london/pimlico-plumbers-charlie-mullins-london-mayor-b956716.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Pimlico Plumbers founder Charlie Mullins may run for London mayor"}, {"author_container": "By    Laura Sharman @LauraSharman_ 22 September 2021"}, {"post_date": "2021-09-22 20:20:29"}, {"article_body": "Pimlico Plumbers founder Charlie Mullins said he is considering whether to run as a candidate in the next London mayoral elections.\n The entrepreneur, 68, might throw his hat in the ring in 2024 after selling his plumbing business this week in a deal estimated to be worth between up to \u00a3145 million.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a few years away so let\u2019s see how things go but I\u2019m not going to rule out running for London mayor,\u201d he told Times Enterprise Network. \n Mr Mullins, dubbed Britain\u2019s first millionaire plumber, considered running for London Mayor in the 2021 elections which saw Sadiq Khan voted into a second term in office.\n However, he pulled out after deciding that a political career would not work while also representing Pimlico Plumbers which he founded in 1979.\n The next election is due to take place after Mr Khan serves his three-year term.\n Speaking from his Spanish villa in Marbella, Mr Mullins told how selling the firm gives him the chance to do other things including representing London and focusing on the music industry.\n He also recently revealed his son Scott remains chief executive.\n \u201cIt was a big decision to make, to step away completely.

But the end date for the project was moved to the end of 2021 when Mr Khan gave the final go-ahead last November.\n Today GLA staff were told that City Hall would close on Friday November 26 but the Crystal, for which the GLA acquired the freehold several years ago, would not be ready until \u201cmid December\u201d.\n This means that the London Assembly, the 25-member cross-party body that scrutinises the Mayor, its staff and other GLA staff working for the Mayor will not have a permanent home until near Christmas.\n The final Mayor\u2019s Question Time, the monthly questioning of Mr Khan, is due to be held on December 16. The City Hall chamber can continue to be used until December 2, it is understood, but staff face at least three weeks desk-hopping. Many fear the disruption continuing into the New Year.\n Sources today suggested that assembly meetings in early December may have to be held at the London Fire Brigade headquarters, in Union Street, Southwark, or at the Barbican.\n GLA Conservative Leader Susan Hall said: \u201cIt is hugely disappointing that the London Assembly will be temporarily homeless because of the Mayor\u2019s decision to move City Hall to the Royal Docks.\n \u201cFar from saving taxpayers\u2019 money, the Mayor\u2019s plan is proving to be a costly distraction from City Hall\u2019s important work. We\u2019ve already seen the moving costs soar by 70 per cent to \u00a313.6 million and it\u2019s likely the final bill will be even higher.\n \u201cWe warned the Mayor that his plan to move to the Crystal building was half-baked. It\u2019s becoming clearer by the day that Sadiq Khan\u2019s decision to abandon a custom built home for City Hall is a catastrophic mistake for London\u2019s government.\n \u201cWe will not allow Sadiq Khan\u2019s moving fiasco to frustrate the Assembly\u2019s efforts to hold him to account.\u201d\n The move to The Crystal was due to have started in the summer. Mayoral sources today denied it had been delayed, and said the GLA\u2019s new home was \u201con track\u201d to open by mid-December.\n Last year the Standard revealed that the cost of converting The Crystal has soared from \u00a38m to \u00a313.6m \u2013 including \u00a33.6m of security measures to protect Mr Khan and the assembly members.\n Mr Khan first proposed the move in June last year to save \u00a355m over five years. The latest estimate is for a saving of \u00a361m over five years or \u00a397m over 10 years.\n The total amount of space in The Crystal is less than in City Hall \u2013 meaning staff will have to work from home for half the week or relocate permanently to Union Street or Transport for London\u2019s Palestra building in Southwark.\n A spokesperson for the Mayor said: \u201cThe Greater London Authority is on track to move to The Crystal building in the Royal Docks by Christmas, saving taxpayers \u00a361m over five years.\n \u201cAs part of the relocation, the GLA will leave its current home near London Bridge on November 26. Assembly meetings scheduled for the first week of December will still take place at the current City Hall and arrangements will be put in place to hold Assembly meetings due for later in the month at a suitable alternative location.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/09/22/14/newFile-1.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=2009%3A1340%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Crystal clear: The Crystal in the Royal Docks, pictured from the Emirates cable car across the Thames</p>"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/29/12/09_Jan_JS_London_54.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "24-hour Tube strikes cost TfL \u00a313 million in lost fares"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/28/13/2de9f0e2aa020d7b20046197d3a34e84Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ4NTUyNjYx-2.65645264.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "New Met Police Commissioner to be appointed in the summer"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/02/11/13/0a3849c7ecdfc6ed66b123eccb515e86Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQ0NjcxNTY2-2.55734824.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Patel orders review into way Khan ousted Dame Cressida as Met boss"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/08/12/Secret_Cinema_-_Bridgerton_-_16th_February_2022_by_Luke_Dyson_-_LD2_0032.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt": "Bridgerton fans: don\u2019t miss this immersive Secret Cinema experience"}, {"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2021/07/23/10/urnpublicidap-2.orgb3289fadabc64681b3aecc4a8037b1c4?width=640&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=4881%3A3200%2Csmart", "alt": "<p>Mayor Sadiq Khan: Moving East to save taxpayers\u2019 cash </p>"}]}]}, {"url": "https://standard.co.uk/news/mayor/luisa-porritt-pins-hopes-on-positivity-lib-dems-mayoral-race-local-elections-b933366.html", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Luisa Porritt pins hopes on positivity as Lib Dems target south-west London in mayoral race"}, {"author_container": "By    Ross Lydall @RossLydall 05 May 2021"}, {"post_date": "2021-05-05 13:52:35"}, {"article_body": "Lib-Dem mayoral candidate Luisa Porritt was on Wednesday \u201cchannelling the spirit of Beyonc\u00e9\u201d as she sought a last-minute surge in support.\n She was joining party leader Sir Ed Davey in Surbiton as she pinned her hopes on a positive message securing votes in the party\u2019s south-west London stronghold.\n Ms Porritt, 33, said: \u201cThe message on the doorstep is that a lot of voters are not particularly impressed by Sadiq Khan and his record.

Run The World (Girls) is the tune for the day.\u201d\n Tory candidate Shaun Bailey was visiting a Covid-19 vaccination centre in Kennington, then meeting party activists as part of his \u201cget out the vote\u201d campaign. \n Polling suggests he has gained ground on Mr Khan by winning over traditional Tory voters.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just the case of spreading the word,\u201d Mr Bailey told the Standard. \u201cYou speak to anyone who will listen.\u201d\n Mr Bailey, who met with vaccines deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi this morning, said his focus on crime had attracted attention but it was the offer of a \u201cfresh start\u201d that was winning votes. \n Green candidate Sian Berry was in Lambeth, Tulse Hill and Nunhead, pledging to strengthen the rights of renters, support low-traffic neighbourhoods and introduce more school streets.\n She called on Londoners to vote \u201cSian then Khan\u201d with their first and second preferences to give her and the Green party the chance of their best-ever result.\n Ms Berry said: \u201cLondon has the chance to do something amazing. We can elect our first ever Green mayor if you give me your first preference vote.\n \u201cThis election has a fair voting system. Your first vote is for your first choice. Your second vote is for second best - that\u2019s your insurance. So give your first vote for mayor to the Greens.\u201d\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/03/03/14/INDUSTRY%20Tube%20%2008452542.jpg?width=230&auto=webp&quality=75", "alt":
