It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. \nYahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv and just outside the city of Chernihiv which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. \nWhen they entered, they took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. \nSixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. \nAs we climbed down a short flight of stairs, we began to smell the stench of disease and decay. The room was dirty - some mattresses, clothes, shoes and books were strewn on the floor, there were four small cots in the centre and a stash of utensils in one corner. \nMykola took us straight to the far end of the room. \n\"This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,\" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. \"I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this.\"\nMykola said you couldn't move at all for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive, including babies. The youngest was just two months old. \nRussian forces were quick to reach villages such as Yahidne as they launched their assault on Chernihiv. For weeks the city of about 300,000 people was cut off as Russian forces surrounded and bombed it, having met resistance. They also destroyed a bridge on the road to the capital Kyiv, leaving residents with nowhere to flee. \nNow the Russians have withdrawn following their failure to take Kyiv. The BBC is one of the first news organisations to reach the area and the horror of what happened under both occupation and bombardment can be revealed. So close to the border, people worry too that the Russians could soon return.\nFifteen-year-old Anastasiia was in the Yahidne basement along with her father and grandmother. \n\"There was barely any room. We were living sitting up. We were sleeping sitting up. Not that we slept at all. It was impossible. So many shells were landing around here. It was unbearable,\" she said.\nThe room had no ventilation. Its two windows were boarded up. \n\"During my time here, 12 people died,\" Mykola said. \nMost of them were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. \nWhen people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. Russian soldiers would not allow it every day. And because of the constant fighting outside - mortar shelling, explosions and gunfire - it was dangerous as well.\nThis meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside.\n\"It was very scary. I knew the people who died,\" says Anastasiia. \"They treated us very kindly. I felt so sad, they just died here for no reason.\"\n\"In normal conditions, they would not have died. Putin is a war criminal,\" said Mykola. \n\"My feet had begun to swell up. But I kept thinking to myself, I have to survive. I have to, for my daughter and two granddaughters.\"\nMost of the time people were not allowed to go out even to use a toilet. They were made to use buckets instead. \n\"Sometimes the soldiers took people out to use them as shields,\" Mykola said.\nThey were allowed to cook on open fires outside twice a day. The village had enough food stocks and a well for water. \nOne of the Russian soldiers told Mykola they had been told they would be in Ukraine for just four days, which would be enough to take over Kyiv. \nOn 3 April, the Russians withdrew from Yahidne. \nUkrainian soldiers are now in the village, and most of those who were trapped have been evacuated to areas nearby. \n\"I wake up many times every night. I feel like I can hear the sound of shooting. I run to my parents, scared,\" says Anastasiia. \nThe Russians occupied villages like Yahidne around Chernihiv in a bid to lay siege to the city and eventually take control of it. \nThey weren't able to enter the city, but there's been extensive destruction to many parts of it and officials say around 350 civilians have been killed.\nSince Russia's withdrawal from around Chernihiv, volunteers have been burying the dead. One part of the local graveyard is now entirely full of fresh graves, with a placard stuck in each, for the purpose of identification. \nFamilies who have been separated have been coming to see if they can find the grave of their loved ones. \nA local football stadium was bombed, Ukrainian officials say by Russian aircraft. A giant crater can be seen in the centre of the field where one bomb fell. Another destroyed a part of the stands, now a mangled mess of broken plastic seats and metal railings.\nNext to the stadium, a children's library housed in a historic building has also been badly damaged. \nAs we drove through the city, we passed several residential neighbourhoods which have been almost flattened. \nAt Novoselivka, in the north of Chernihiv, destruction is visible as far as the eye can see. \nPiles of stones and bricks lie where homes must have stood. We saw a child's pink winter jacket, a teddy bear, a stuffed elephant and pieces of Lego on one of the paths going into the residential area.\nAlong the way, we saw more bomb craters. \nA woman and child on bicycles gestured to us to follow them. \nSixty-two-year-old Nina Vynnyk and her grandson, 10-year-old Danylo, wanted to show us their home -  only a shell now, everything in and around it has been destroyed. \nNina's daughter and Danylo's mother, 39-year-old Ludmyla, has lost her leg and is in hospital.\nWhen Nina's home began to be shelled, they ran to another person's house hoping to seek shelter in their basement. But that was bombed too. \n\"We were knocked out by the explosion. Someone got a concussion, someone was injured. When we came to our senses, I saw that my daughter was screaming, 'Mummy, mummy I don't have a leg'. It was horrible,\" she said.\nLudmyla crawled to safety and was taken to a hospital. \n\"I feel like this is a terrible nightmare. It can't be true. Why didn't our government warn us? Why didn't they evacuate us,\" said Nina. \nFour generations of her family lived in the home. \"In one moment, there is nothing left. I don't know where I will live in the winter,\" she said.\nShe can't afford to pay for prosthetics for her daughter. \nOn Russian statements that they have not targeted civilians, she says, \"He [Putin] is full of lies. There is a woman in a hospital without a leg. That is the truth. \n\"Let Putin pay for her surgery. Let Putin build this house. He wanted it so much, didn't he? Let him pay for all of it now.\"\nAdditional reporting by Imogen Anderson, Anastasiia Levchenko and Daria Sipigina\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/20F6/production/_124083480_mykola.jpg", "alt": "Mykola Klymchuk"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0030/production/_124084000_mediaitem124083999.jpg", "alt": "basement in yahidne"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10200/production/_124084066_mediaitem124084005.jpg", "alt": "anastasia"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13842/production/_124083997_mediaitem124083996.jpg", "alt": "destroyed building in chernihiv"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/130E0/production/_124084087_mediaitem124084086.jpg", "alt": "chernihiv"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/112C2/production/_124083307_nina.jpg", "alt": "Nina"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-europe-61028380", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Bucha murders: German report says Russian troops discussed killings"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 16:46:46"}, {"article_body": "Russian troops were heard discussing killing civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, in messages intercepted by German intelligence, German media say.\nDer Spiegel magazine says some of the radio traffic tracked by the BND intelligence agency appears to match locations of bodies just outside Kyiv. \nThe BND has so far made no public comments on the issue.\nUkraine says more than 300 civilians were killed by the Russians in Bucha - Moscow denies any involvement.\nRecent images of Bucha streets strewn with bodies have shocked the international community. Some of the victims appeared to have been shot in the back of the head after their hands were tied.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of genocide, an accusation flatly rejected by Moscow.\nWarning: This piece contains graphic images which some may find upsetting.\nBucha was seized by Russian troops soon after President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.\nAfter more than a month, the Russians eventually withdrew from Bucha, and Ukrainian forces soon entered the town.\nThe BND's intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday, Der Spiegel reported on Thursday.\nIn one intercepted radio message, the magazine said, Russian soldiers appeared to be talking about interrogating people and then shooting them. \nIn another, a soldier talked about shooting someone on a bike, which appeared to match a notorious photo showing a dead cyclist in Bucha. \nAccording to Spiegel, the intercepts also appeared to indicate that mercenaries from Russia's private Wagner group played a key role in the Bucha killings.\nAn unnamed security source told Reuters news agency: \"It's true that the [German] federal government has indications of Russian perpetration in Bucha\".\n\"However, these findings on Bucha refer to satellite images.

And she agreed with Republican senators about the importance of abiding by the text of the Constitution, as it was intended by the founders.  \nDuring her confirmation, Democrats touted her experience working as a public defender. She will be the first Supreme Court justice since Thurgood Marshall - the first black Supreme Court justice -  to have career experience representing criminal defendants.\nThe jurist, a Washington DC native, currently sits on the influential US court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. She worked as a public defender in Washington before joining a private practice prior to her judicial appointments.\nSome Republicans took issue with clients Ms Jackson took on as a public defence lawyer - namely terrorism suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, with some accusing her of being soft on crime.\nOthers, however, applauded the diversity of experience her legal career would bring to the bench over the course of what was at times highly fractious and almost entirely polarised six week confirmation process.\nSenator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of three Republicans to vote in favour of Justice Jackson said this decision rested, in part, as a \"rejection of the corrosive politicisation\" that has come to shape the confirmation process.\nThe new justice \"will bring to the Supreme Court a range of experience from the courtroom that few can match given her background in litigation,\" Ms Murkowski said. \nThe top court plays a crucial role in American public life and is often the last word on highly contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government. \nKetanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation is a historic one as the appointment of the first black female justice. It's also notable because her professional background differs markedly from recent justices. She is the first since Thurgood Marshall in 1967 to come to the court with extensive experience as a criminal defence attorney.\nA recent Cato Institute study found that throughout the federal court system, former prosecutors outnumber defence attorneys by four to one.\nSome conservatives have accused Ms Jackson of being \"soft\" on criminals, pointing to her experience as a public defender and willingness as a federal judge to issue prison sentences below federal guidelines. While her supporters vociferously dispute this, Ms Jackson is likely to bring a different perspective to the court, particularly on the criminal procedure cases that regularly appear on the docket.\nAs one of nine justices, replacing one of only three liberals on the court, her arrival may have a negligible impact on the court rulings. She has a lifetime appointment to assert her influence, however. And even if she's not penning majority rulings, that influence can come through private interactions with justices and through dissenting opinions that could preview new legal principles if the court's ideological balance someday shifts.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EA53/production/_124078995_kbjtop.jpg", "alt": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson at her confirmation hearing"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/27FB/production/_112953201__104759290_anthonyzurcher_tr-nc.png", "alt": "Analysis box by Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png", "alt": "line"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60991746", "page_details": [{"live_report": 1}, {"post_title": "Ukraine war latest: Battles in Donbas will look like World War Two, says Ukraine - BBC News"}, {"summary": "Summary:\n- The battle for the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine will remind the world of World War Two and involve thousands of tanks, Ukraine's foreign minister says\n- Dmytro Kuleba asks Nato allies to provide \"everything we need, and we will fight not only for our security, but for your security\"\n- Nato's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance is ready to strengthen support but does not provide details of weapons\n- Western officials and military analysts say they expect an intense Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine in the next few weeks\n- Residents in Yahidne, near Chernihiv, tell the BBC Russian troops held 130 people in a basement for four weeks - and 12 people died\n- The BBC has been told that Russian troops used villagers in northern Ukraine as human shields against counter-attacks\n- Meanwhile Russia is suspended from the UN Human Rights Council over alleged war crimes after a vote in New York"}, {"articles": [{"article": [{"post_date": "2022-04-07 21:20:00.000000"}, {"post_title": "Nobel winner says he was attacked on Russian train"}, {"post_body": " Russia's Nobel Peace Prize winning journalist Dmitry Muratov says he has been attacked with red paint laced with the solvent acetone on a train in Russia.

Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a \"strategic coffee break\". Western nations view Russia\u2019s suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive.  Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the council\u2019s own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bachelet\u2019s long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations?

Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accurate when he said the fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? \u201cYes I think that\u2019s accurate,\" Reynolds said. \"With all the forces freed up\nfrom the north of Ukraine\u2026 we\u2019re going to see a clash of arms on European soil\nthat hasn\u2019t been seen for generations.\" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east \u201cthe map has\nstill been slowly turning red\u201d, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north.  So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a \"significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite\", Reynolds says. Western arms will be \"absolutely essential\" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade drones could \u201cstart to change things on the ground within a short\ntimeframe\u201d \u2013 but there\u2019s \u201cvery little else\u201d that could do so, he adds.

Scientists wanted to find out when that risk returns to normal levels.\nThe researchers tracked the health of just over one million people who tested positive for Covid between February 2020 and May 2021 in Sweden, and compared them with four million people of the same age and sex who had not had a positive test.\nAfter a Covid infection, they found an increased risk of:\nWhen the researchers compared the risks of blood clots after Covid to the normal level of risk, they found that:\nThe study, published in the BMJ, said the raised risk of blood clots was higher in the first wave than later waves, probably because treatments improved during the pandemic and older patients were starting to be vaccinated by the second wave.\nThe risk of a blood clot in the lung in people who were very seriously ill with Covid was 290 times greater than normal, and seven times higher than normal after mild Covid. But there was no raised risk of internal bleeding in mild cases.\n\"For unvaccinated individuals, that's a really good reason to get a vaccine - the risk is so much higher than the risk from vaccines,\" says Anne-Marie Fors Connolly, principal study investigator from Umea University in Sweden.\nThe researchers can't prove that Covid caused the blood clots in this study but they have several theories on why it happens.\nIt could be the direct effect of the virus on the layer of cells which line blood vessels, an exaggerated inflammatory response to the virus, or the body making blood clots at inappropriate times.\nVaccines are very effective against severe Covid, but offer less protection against infection, particularly with the Omicron variant - meaning repeat infections with symptoms are common as countries work out how to live with Covid.\nFrederick K Ho, public health lecturer from the University of Glasgow, said this study \"reminds us of the need to remain vigilant to the complications associated with even mild [Covid] infection, including thromboembolism\".\nThe risk of blood clots goes up after vaccination, but \"the magnitude of risk remains smaller and persists for a shorter period than that associated with infection\", he adds.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1008C/production/_124067656_gettyimages-1303391123.jpg", "alt": "Doctors treating a Covid patient in ICU"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/science-environment-61013740", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Tanis: Fossil of dinosaur killed in asteroid strike found, scientists claim"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-06 20:59:26"}, {"article_body": "Scientists have presented a stunningly preserved leg of a dinosaur.\nThe limb, complete with skin, is just one of a series of remarkable finds emerging from the Tanis fossil site in the US State of North Dakota.\nBut it's not just their exquisite condition that's turning heads - it's what these ancient specimens are purported to represent.\nThe claim is the Tanis creatures were killed and entombed on the actual day a giant asteroid struck Earth.\nThe day 66 million years ago when the reign of the dinosaurs ended and the rise of mammals began.\nVery few dinosaur remains have been found in the rocks that record even the final few thousand years before the impact. To have a specimen from the cataclysm itself would be extraordinary.\nThe BBC has spent three years filming at Tanis for a show to be broadcast on 15 April, narrated by Sir David Attenborough.\nSir David will review the discoveries, many that will be getting their first public viewing. \nAlong with that leg, there are fish that breathed in impact debris as it rained down from the sky.\nWe see a fossil turtle that was skewered by a wooden stake; the remains of small mammals and the burrows they made; skin from a horned triceratops; the embryo of a flying pterosaur inside its egg; and what appears to be a fragment from the asteroid impactor itself.\n\"We've got so many details with this site that tell us what happened moment by moment, it's almost like watching it play out in the movies. You look at the rock column, you look at the fossils there, and it brings you back to that day,\" says Robert DePalma, the University of Manchester, UK, graduate student who leads the Tanis dig.\nIt's now widely accepted that a roughly 12km-wide space rock hit our planet to cause the last mass extinction.\nThe impact site has been identified in the Gulf of Mexico, off the Yucatan Peninsula. That's some 3,000km away from Tanis, but such was the energy imparted in the event, its devastation was felt far and wide.\nThe North Dakota fossil site is a chaotic jumble.\nThe remains of animals and plants seem to have been rolled together into a sediment dump by waves of river water set in train by unimaginable earth tremors. Aquatic organisms are mixed in with the land-based creatures.\nThe sturgeon and paddlefish in this fossil tangle are key. They have small particles stuck in their gills. These are the spherules of molten rock kicked out from the impact that then fell back across the planet. The fish would have breathed in the particles as they entered the river.\nThe spherules have been linked chemically and by radiometric dating to the Mexican impact location, and in two of the particles recovered from preserved tree resin there are also tiny inclusions that imply an extra-terrestrial origin.\n\"When we noticed there were inclusions within these little glass spherules, we chemically analysed them at the Diamond X-ray synchrotron near Oxford,\" explains Prof Phil Manning, who is Mr DePalma's PhD supervisor at Manchester.\n\"We were able to pull apart the chemistry and identify the composition of that material. All the evidence, all of the chemical data, from that study suggests strongly that we're looking at a piece of the impactor; of the asteroid that ended it for the dinosaurs.\"\nThe existence of Tanis, and the claims made for it, first emerged in the public sphere in the New Yorker Magazine in 2019. This caused a furore at the time.\nScience usually demands the initial presentation of new discoveries is made in the pages of a scholarly journal. A few peer-reviewed papers have now been published, and the dig team promises many more as it works through the meticulous process of extracting, preparing and describing the fossils.\nTo make its TV programme, the BBC called in outside consultants to examine a number of the finds.\nProf Paul Barrett from London's Natural History Museum looked at the leg. He's an expert in ornithischian (mostly plant-eating) dinosaurs.\n\"It's a Thescelosaurus. It's from a group that we didn't have any previous record of what its skin looked like, and it shows very conclusively that these animals were very scaly like lizards. They weren't feathered like their meat-eating contemporaries.\n\"This looks like an animal whose leg has simply been ripped off really quickly. There's no evidence on the leg of disease, there are no obvious pathologies, there's no trace of the leg being scavenged, such as bite marks or bits of it that are missing,\" he tells me.\n\"So, the best idea that we have is that this is an animal that died more or less instantaneously.\"\nThe big question is whether this dinosaur did actually die on the day the asteroid struck, as a direct result of the ensuing cataclysm. The Tanis team thinks it very likely did, given the limb's position in the dig sediments.\nIf that is the case, it would be quite the discovery.\nBut Prof Steve Brusatte from University of Edinburgh says he's sceptical - for the time being.\nHe's acted as another of the BBC's outside consultants. He wants to see the arguments presented in more peer-reviewed articles, and for some palaeo-scientists with very specific specialisms to go into the site to give their independent assessment.\nProf Brusatte says it's possible, for example, that animals that had died before the impact were exhumed by the violence on the day and then re-interred in a way that made their deaths appear concurrent.\n\"Those fish with the spherules in their gills, they're an absolute calling card for the asteroid. But for some of the other claims - I'd say they have a lot circumstantial evidence that hasn't yet been presented to the jury,\" he says.\n\"For some of these discoveries, though, does it even matter if they died on the day or years before? The pterosaur egg with a pterosaur baby inside is super-rare; there's nothing else like it from North America. It doesn't all have to be about the asteroid.\"\nThere's no doubting the pterosaur egg is special.\nWith modern X-ray technology it's possible to determine the chemistry and properties of the egg shell. It was likely leathery rather than hard, which may indicate the pterosaur mother buried the egg in sand or sediment like a turtle.\nIt's also possible with X-ray tomography to extract virtually the bones of the pterosaur chick inside, to print them and reconstruct what the animal would have looked like. Mr DePalma has done this.\nThe baby pterosaur was probably a type of azhdarchid, a group of flying reptiles whose adult wings could reach more than 10m from tip to tip.\nMr DePalma gave a special lecture on the Tanis discoveries to an audience at the US space agency Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center on Wednesday. He and Prof Manning will also present their latest data to the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in May.\nDinosaurs: The Final Day with Sir David Attenborough will be broadcast on BBC One on 15 April at 18:30 BST.

There are no official statistics but it is estimated 100,000 Koreans are addicted to sleeping pills. \nWhen they still can't sleep they often resort to drinking alcohol on top of the medication - with dangerous consequences. \n''People sleep walk. They go to the refrigerator and eat a lot of things unconsciously, including uncooked food,'' Dr Lee says. ''There were even cases of car accidents in the centre of Seoul caused by a sleepwalking patient.'' \nDr Lee is used to seeing chronic insomniacs suffering from what is known as hypo-arousal. Some of her patients tell her it has been decades since they have slept for more than a few hours a night.  \n''They cry [but] still hold a single thread of hope [when they come here]. It's a really sad situation,'' she says. \nSouth Korea is one of the most sleep deprived nations on earth. It also has the highest suicide rate among developed nations, the highest consumption of hard liquor and a huge number of people on antidepressants. \nThere are historic reasons for these statistics.  \nIn just a few decades the country has gone from being one of the poorest countries on earth to one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. It also wields considerable soft power, with its growing influence on pop culture.  \nNations with a similar trajectory, like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, could tap into their natural resources, but Korea has no such hidden wealth. It transformed itself through the sheer dedication of a population driven by a collective nationalism pushing them to work harder and faster. \nOne result is that its people are overworked, stressed out and sleep deprived. \nNow, an entire industry has grown around catering to those who can't sleep - with the sleep industry estimated to be worth $2.5bn in 2019.  \nIn Seoul, whole department stores are devoted to sleep products, from the perfect sheets to the optimum pillow, while pharmacies offer shelves full of herbal sleep remedies and tonics. \nAnd then there are the tech approaches to insomnia. A little over two years ago Daniel Tudor started a meditation app - Kokkiri - aimed at helping stressed out young Koreans.  \nAlthough Korea is historically a Buddhist country, young people think of meditation as an old person's pastime, not something an office worker in Seoul might do. Daniel says he had to re-import and re-package meditation as a Western idea for young Koreans to find it attractive. \nMore traditional institutions have also joined in on the action. \nHyerang Sunim is a Buddhist nun who helps run a Temple-Stay retreat on the edge of Seoul where the sleep-deprived can engage in meditation and absorb Buddhist teachings. \nIn the past these kinds of mini-breaks were reserved for retirees who wanted teachings and prayer. Now the participants tend to be younger, working-age Koreans. But these same Buddhist temples have also been criticised for making a profit from such retreats.  \n''Of course there are concerns\u2026 but I think the benefits outweigh them,'' said Hyerang Sunim. \n''Traditionally it has been rare to see young people come and seek the Buddhist teachings. And they are getting a lot out of their interactions with the temple stay.'' \nLee Hye-ri, who attended one such Buddhist retreat after the pressure at work became too much, says she has learned to take responsibility for her stress. \n''Everything starts from me, all problems start with me. That's what I learned here.'' \nBut framing the solution to stress and sleep deprivation as something to be dealt with at the individual level can be problematic.\nThose who believe the problem is caused by an unreasonable work culture and societal pressures have criticised this individualistic approach saying it is tantamount to victim-blaming. These critics say meditation or relaxation is a sticking plaster and that real solutions can only come about through fundamental changes to society. \nJi-Eun was eventually so sleep deprived and stressed that she quit her job. These days she works far more reasonable hours as a freelancer and the pandemic means she can work from home. She has also sought professional help at Dr Lee's sleep clinic to manage her insomnia.  \n''What's the point of working so hard now that we've made it as a country?'' Ji-Eun says. ''We should be able to relax.'' \n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5550/production/_123704812_gettyimages-55746129.jpg", "alt": "Elderly South Korean job seekers sleep during an elderly persons' job fair on September 23, 2005 in Seoul, South Korea."}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13BC8/production/_123704808_drsleepclinic.jpg", "alt": "Female doctor stands in front of a reception desk with the sign Dream Sleep Clinic glowing in the background"}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A370/production/_123704814_gettyimages-1208680280.jpg", "alt": "Office workers wearing face masks amid concerns over the COVID-19 novel coronavirus walk past blossoms during their lunch break in central Seoul on March 31, 2020."}, {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EDA8/production/_123704806_templestay.jpg", "alt": "A group of men and women sit cross-legged facing a monk in a sparsely-decorated room in a Buddhist temple"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-61021460", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Oil giant Shell to take \u00a33.8bn hit by leaving Russia"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 09:18:35"}, {"article_body": "Oil giant Shell has confirmed it will take a hit of up to $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) from offloading its Russian assets as part of plans to withdraw from the country.\nThe firm has pledged to no longer buy oil, but contracts signed before the invasion of Ukraine will be fulfilled.\nThe costs of Shell no longer doing business in Russia include quitting joint ventures with Gazprom.\nShell was criticised when it bought Russian crude oil at a cheap price shortly after the war began.\nIn response to the outrage, the company apologised and pledged to stop buying oil from Russia.\nThe company said it would cost between $4bn and $5bn to cut ties with the country.\n\"Shell has not renewed longer-term contracts for Russian oil, and will only do so under explicit government direction, but we are legally obliged to take delivery of crude bought under contracts that were signed before the invasion,\" the company said.\nThe oil firm added that the state of the global oil markets remained \"volatile\".\nBrent Crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - was trading at about $100 a barrel early on Thursday, but its price has risen to record levels since the war in the Ukraine.\nThe rise in oil prices is due to Russia being one of the world's largest exporters of the commodity and fears of supplies being disrupted because of the conflict.\nThough the UK gets very little of its oil from Russia, it has been affected by the global rise in prices, which has seen petrol and diesel prices hit record levels.\nAs part of Shell's withdrawal plans, the company said previously it would offload a 27.5% stake in a Russian liquefied natural gas facility, a 50% stake in an oilfield project in Siberia and an energy joint venture.\nIt will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, which has been put on hold by ministers in Berlin.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F62C/production/_123602036_bloke.png", "alt": "Worker at Shell petrol station in Russia"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-61027374", "page_details": [{"post_title": "Canada proposes foreign buyers home real estate ban"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 20:20:46"}, {"article_body": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has proposed a two-year ban on some foreigners buying homes.\nThe measure comes as the country grapples with some of the worst housing affordability issues in the world.\nPrices have jumped more than 20%, pushing the average home in Canada to nearly C$817,000 ($650,000; \u00a3495,000) -  more than nine times household income.\nBut industry analysts say it's not clear a ban on foreign buyers will address the problem.\nData on purchases by foreign buyers in Canada is limited, but research suggests they amount for a small fraction of the market.\n\"I don't think\u00a0it's going to have a huge\u00a0impact,\" said Ben Myers, president of advisory firm Bullpenn Research & Consulting in Toronto, who found foreigners accounted for just 1% of purchases in 2020, down from 9% in 2015 and 2016.\n\"It's a fairly low number and let's face it, the people that really want to buy ... are going to find alternative ways to do it.\"\nMr Myers said the soaring housing costs reflect strong population growth and a shortage of supply, due in part to rules that restrict development.\nThe issues have worsened since the pandemic hit in 2020, when policymakers in Canada and elsewhere slashed interest rates to stabilise the economy, lowering borrowing costs and boosting demand even further.\nThe moves have fuelled the soaring housing prices seen in many markets around the world, but in Canada the disconnect between home prices and incomes is one of the most dramatic, according to OECD data.\nMr Trudeau pledged to tackle housing affordability during his campaign for election last year.\nIn addition to the temporary ban on foreign buyers, the budget proposal his government unveiled on Thursday sets aside billions to spur new construction and proposes new programmes, such as a tax-free savings account for first-time buyers. \nMr Trudeau has also discussed banning certain bidding processes that favour investors, who by some measures have accounted for about one in five homes purchased in Canada since 2014.\nThe proposed ban on foreign buyers would exempt permanent residents and foreign students and workers, as well as those buying their primary residence. \nThe proposal builds on actions such as special taxes that some parts of Canada have already taken against out-of-town and foreign buyers.\nIn Ontario, for example, provincial Premier Doug Ford recently announced plans to raise an existing tax on foreign buyers from 15% to 20% and expand it beyond Toronto to the entire province.\nWhile foreign purchases are not the driver of the affordability issues, taxing them at least captures revenue that can be re-deployed to address such problems, said Steve Pomeroy, head of Focus Consulting, a housing policy firm.\n\"If you ban them, you don't really have much of an impact on suppressing rising home prices and you give up the revenue,\" he said.\nNew Zealand introduced a similar measure banning foreign buyers in 2018.\n\"It's good politics because it's easy to blame a victim that nobody cares about,\" Mr Pomeroy added. \"I don't think it will have much of an impact.\" \nPaul Kershaw, professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of Generation Squeeze, also said he saw little in  Mr Trudeau's proposal likely to slow price increases or significantly address affordability.\n\"It's not clear the housing measures will be sufficient to break Canada's addiction to high and rising home prices,\" he said, noting that for existing homeowners, the high prices help amass wealth.\nMr Pomeroy said he does expect price appreciation to slow in coming months, as the central bank raises interest rates. The Canadian housing market is particularly susceptible to such moves, since many buyers rely on five-year mortgages rather than the long-term ones common in the US and UK.\nBut higher interest rates will only make it less affordable for prospective buyers trying to break into the market, he warned.\nMr Myers said over the long-term, he expects hot markets such as Toronto and Vancouver to become dominated by renters, as regular buyers get priced out of the market, unless politicians address supply.\nBut Mr Pomeroy said high development costs means that adding supply will not necessarily reduce prices, unless the additions are dramatic.\n\"Unless you've got born into the right family ... the prospects for young buyers are quite dim,\" he said.\n"}, {"images": [{"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/941E/production/_124081973_whatsubject.jpg", "alt": "Justin Trudeau has promised to address Canada's soaring home prices"}]}]}, {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-61019241", "page_details": [{"post_title": "China lockdowns: Tourism spending plunges over key holiday"}, {"post_date": "2022-04-07 05:00:07"}, {"article_body": "Tourism spending in China plunged during this week's Qingming festival, as the world's second largest economy battles a rise in infections.\nThe amount tourists spent during the key three-day holiday was more than 30% lower than the same time last year, official figures show.\nIt comes as travel restrictions in China continue, and Shanghai and other cities remain locked down. \nShanghai is the largest city to go into lockdown to date.\nThe Qingming festival, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day, is usually a time when people visit the graves of family and friends to pay their respects.\nThis would often mean people travelling from their homes to other parts of China, which can provide a boost for consumer spending.\nThe festival took place from Sunday 3 April to Tuesday 5 April this year. \nLocal tourists spent 18.78bn yuan ($2.95bn; \u00a32.26bn) over the three days, according to China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
